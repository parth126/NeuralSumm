        "10": "A key insight in that regard is to posit that the meaning of a word is captured by \u201cthe company it keeps\u201d (Firth, 1957) and, therefore, that two words that keep company with similar words are likely to be similar themselves.", 
        "11": "In the simplest case, one seeks vectors whose inner products approximate the co-occurrence frequencies.",

        "13": "An alternative to seeking word-embeddings that reflect co-occurrence statistics is to extract the vectorial representation of words from non-linear statistical language models, specifically neural networks.", 
        "14": "(Bengio et al., 2003) already proposed (i) associating with each vocabulary word a feature vector, (ii) expressing the probability function of word sequences in terms of the feature vectors of the words in the sequence, and (iii) learning simultaneously the vectors and the parameters of the probability function.", 
        "15": "This approach came into prominence recently through works of Mikolov et al.",

        "17": "An unexpected side effect of deriving wordembeddings via neural networks is that the wordvectors produced appear to enjoy (approximate) additive compositionality: adding two wordvectors often results in a vector whose nearest word-vector belongs to the word capturing the composition of the added words, e.g., \u201cman\u201d + \u201croyal\u201d = \u201cking\u201d (Mikolov et al., 2013c).",

        "19": "In this work we focus on explaining the source of this phenomenon for the most prominent such model, namely the Skip-Gram model introduced in (Mikolov et al., 2013a).", 
        "20": "The Skip-Gram model learns vector representations of words based on their patterns of co-occurrence in the training corpus as follows: it assigns to each word c in the vocabulary V , a \u201ccontext\u201d and a \u201ctarget\u201d vector, respectively uc and vc, which are to be used in order to predict the words that appear around each occurrence of c within a window of \u2206 tokens.", 
        "21": "Specifically, the log probability of any target word w to occur at any position within distance \u2206 of a context word c is taken to be proportional to the inner product between uc and vw, i.e., letting n = |V |,\np(w|c) = e uTc vw\n\u2211n i=1 e uTc vi .", 
        "22": "(1)\nFurther, Skip-Gram assumes that the conditional probability of each possible set of words in a window around a context word c factorizes as the product of the respective conditional probabilities:\np(w\u2212\u2206, .",

        "30": "While there has been much interest in using algebraic operations on word vectors to carry out semantic operations like composition, and mathematically-flavored explanations have been offered (e.g., in the recent work (Paperno and Baroni, 2016)), the only published work which attempts a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon is (Arora et al., 2016).", 
        "31": "This work guarantees that word vectors can be recovered by factorizing the so-called PMI matrix, and that algebraic operations on these word vectors can be used to solve analogies, under certain conditions on the process that generated the training corpus.",

        "34": "Finally, the discourse vector is assumed to evolve according to a random walk on the unit sphere that has a uniform stationary distribution.", 
        "35": "By way of contrast, our results assume nothing a priori about the properties of the word vectors.", 
        "36": "In fact, the connection we establish between the Skip-Gram and the Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction model of (Globerson and Tishby, 2003) shows that the word vectors learned by Skip-Gram are information-theoretically optimal.", 
        "37": "Further, the context word c in the Skip-Gram model essentially serves the role that the discourse vector does in the PMI model of (Arora et al., 2016): the words neighboring c are selected with probability proportional to eu T c vw .",

        "41": "While our primary motivation has been to provide a better theoretical understanding of word compositionality in the popular Skip-Gram model, our connection with the SDR method illuminates a much more general point about the practical applicability of the Skip-Gram model.", 
        "42": "In particular, it addresses the question of whether, for a given corpus, fitting a Skip-Gram model will give good embeddings.", 
        "43": "Even if we are making reasonable linguistic assumptions about how to model words and the interdependencies of words in a corpus, it\u2019s not clear that these have to hold universally on all corpuses to which we apply Skip-Gram.", 
        "44": "However, the fact that when we fit a Skip-Gram model we are fitting an SDR model (up to frequency information), and the fact that SDR models are information-theoretically optimal in a certain sense, argues that regardless of whether the Skip-Gram assumptions hold, Skip-Gram always gives us optimal features in the following sense: the learned context embeddings and target embeddings preserve the maximal amount of mutual information between any pair of random variablesX and Y consistent with the observed co-occurence matrix, where Y is the target word and X is the predictor word (in a min-max sense, since there are many ways of coupling X and Y , each of which may have different amounts of mutual information).",

        "168": "One way to understand the success of this approach is to recall that each word c is characterized by a categorical distribution over all other words w, as stated in (1).", 
        "169": "The peaks of this categorical distribution are precisely the words with which c co-occurs most often.", 
        "170": "These words characterize c more than all the other words in the vocabulary, so it is reasonable to expect that a word c\u2032 whose categorical distribution has similar peaks as the categorical distribution of c is similar in meaning to c. Note that the location of the peaks of p(\u00b7|c) are immune to the scaling of uc (athough the values of p(\u00b7|c) may change); thus, the wordsw which best characterize c are those for which vw has a high inner product with uc/\u2016uc\u20162.",

        "172": "3 Skip-Gram learns a Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction Model  The Skip-Gram model assumes that the distribution of the neighbors of a word follows a specific exponential parametrization of a categorical distribution.", 
        "173": "There is empirical evidence that this model generates features that are useful for NLP tasks, but there is no a priori guarantee that the training corpus was generated in this manner.", 
        "174": "In this section, we provide theoretical support for the usefulness of the features learned even when the SkipGram model is misspecified.", 
        "175": "To do so, we draw a connection between SkipGram and the Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction (SDR) factorization of Globerson and Tishby (Globerson and Tishby, 2003).", 
        "176": "The SDR model\nlearns optimal2 embeddings for discrete random variables X and Y without assuming any parametric form on the distributions of X and Y , and it is useful in a variety of applications, including information retrieval, document classification, and association analysis (Globerson and Tishby, 2003).", 
        "177": "As it turns out, these embeddings, like Skip-Gram, are obtained by learning the parameters of an exponentially parameterized distribution.", 
        "178": "In Theorem 3 below, we show that if a SkipGram model is fit to the cooccurence statistics of X and Y , then the output can be trivially modified (by adding readily-available information on word frequencies) to obtain the parameters of an SDR model.", 
        "179": "This connection is significant for two reasons: first, the original algorithm of (Globerson and Tishby, 2003) for learning SDR embeddings is expensive, as it involves information projections.", 
        "180": "Theorem 3 shows that if one can efficiently fit a Skip-Gram model, then one can efficiently fit an SDR model.", 
        "181": "This implies that Skip-Gram specific approximation heuristics like negativesampling, hierarchical softmax, and Glove, which are believed to return high-quality approximations to Skip-Gram parameters (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Pennington et al., 2014), can be used to efficiently approximate SDR model parameters.", 
        "182": "Second, (Globerson and Tishby, 2003) argues for the optimality of the SDR embedding in any domain where the training information on X and Y consists of their coocurrence statistics; this optimality and the Skip-Gram/SDR connection argues for the use of Skip-Gram approximations in such domains, and supports the positive experimental results that have been observed in applications in network science (Grover and Leskovec, 2016), proteinomics (Asgari and Mofrad, 2015), and other fields.", 
        "183": "As stated above, the SDR factorization solves the problem of finding information-theoretically optimal features, given co-occurrence statistics for a pair of discrete random variables X and Y .", 
        "184": "Associate a vector wi to the ith state of X , a vector hj to the jth state of Y , and let W = [wT1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7wT|X|]T and H be defined similarly.", 
        "185": "Globerson and Tishby show that such optimal features can be obtained from a low-rank factoriza-\n2Optimal in an information-theoretic sense: they preserve the maximal mutual information between any pair of random variables with the observed coocurrence statistics, without regard to the underlying joint distribution.",

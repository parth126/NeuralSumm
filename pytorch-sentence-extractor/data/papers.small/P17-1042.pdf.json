        "5": "An alternative approach that we follow here is to independently train the embeddings for each language on monolingual corpora, and then learn a linear transformation to map the embeddings from one space into the other by minimizing the distances in a bilingual dictionary, usually in the range of a few thousand entries (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Artetxe et al., 2016).", 
        "6": "However, dictionaries of that size are not readily available for many language pairs, specially those involving less-resourced languages.",

        "158": "More concretely, we argue that, for the embedding mapping and dictionary induction methods described in Section 3, the proposed selflearning framework is implicitly solving the following global optimization problem8:\nW \u2217 = arg max W\n\u2211\ni\nmax j\n(Xi\u2217W ) \u00b7 Zj\u2217\ns.t.", 
        "159": "WW T = W TW = I\nContrary to the optimization objective for W in Section 3.1, the global optimization objective does not refer to any dictionary, and maximizes the similarity between each source language word and its closest target language word.", 
        "160": "Intuitively, a random solution would map source language embeddings to seemingly random locations in the target language space, and it would thus be unlikely that\nBilBOWA.", 
        "161": "8While we restrict our formal analysis to the embedding mapping and dictionary induction method that we use, the general reasoning should be valid for other choices as well.", 
        "162": "they have any target language word nearby, making the optimization value small.", 
        "163": "In contrast, a good solution would map source language words close to their translation equivalents in the target language space, and they would thus have their corresponding embeddings nearby, making the optimization value large.", 
        "164": "While it is certainly possible to build degenerated solutions that take high optimization values for small subsets of the vocabulary, we think that the structural similarity between independently trained embedding spaces in different languages is strong enough that optimizing this function yields to meaningful bilingual mappings when the size of the vocabulary is much larger than the dimensionality of the embeddings.", 
        "165": "The reasoning for how the self-learning framework is optimizing this objective is as follows.", 
        "166": "At the end of each iteration, the dictionary D is updated to assign, for the current mapping W , each source language word to its closest target language word.", 
        "167": "This way, when we update W to maximize the average similarity of these dictionary entries at the beginning of the next iteration, it is guaranteed that the value of the optimization objective will improve (or at least remain the same).", 
        "168": "The reason is that the average similarity between each word and what were previously the closest words will be improved if possible, as this is what the updated W directly optimizes (see Section 3.1).", 
        "169": "In addition to that, it is also possible that, for some source words, some other target words get closer after the update.", 
        "170": "Thanks to this, our self-learning algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local optimum of the above global objective, behaving like an alternating optimization algorithm for it.", 
        "171": "It is interesting to note that the above reasoning is valid no matter what the the initial solution is, and, in fact, the global optimization objective does not depend on the seed dictionary nor any other\nbilingual resource.", 
        "172": "For that reason, it should be possible to use a random initialization instead of a small seed dictionary.", 
        "173": "However, we empirically observe that this works poorly in practice, as our algorithm tends to get stuck in poor local optima when the initial solution is not good enough.", 
        "174": "The general behavior of our method is reflected in Figure 3, which shows the learning curve for different seed dictionaries according to both the objective function and the accuracy on bilingual lexicon induction.", 
        "175": "As it can be seen, the objective function is improved from iteration to iteration and converges to a local optimum just as expected.", 
        "176": "At the same time, the learning curves show a strong correlation between the optimization objective and the accuracy, as it can be clearly observed that improving the former leads to an improvement of the latter, confirming our explanations.", 
        "177": "Regarding random initialization, the figure shows that the algorithm gets stuck in a poor local optimum of the objective function, which is the reason of the bad performance (0% accuracy) on bilingual lexicon induction, but the proposed optimization objective itself seems to be adequate.", 
        "178": "Finally, we empirically observe that our algorithm learns similar mappings no matter what the seed dictionary was.", 
        "179": "We first repeated our experiments on English-Italian bilingual lexicon induction for 5 different dictionaries of 25 entries, obtaining an average accuracy of 38.15% and a standard deviation of only 0.75%.", 
        "180": "In addition to that, we observe that the overlap between the predictions made when starting with the full dictionary and the numerals dictionary is 76.00% (60.00% for the 25 entry dictionary).", 
        "181": "At the same time,\n37.00% of the test cases are correctly solved by both instances, and it is only 5.07% of the test cases that one of them gets right and the other wrong (34.00% and 8.94% for the 25 entry dictionary).", 
        "182": "This suggests that our algorithm tends to converge to similar solutions even for disjoint seed dictionaries, which is in line with our view that we are implicitly optimizing an objective that is independent from the seed dictionary, yet a seed dictionary is necessary to build a good enough initial solution to avoid getting stuck in poor local optima.", 
        "183": "For that reason, it is likely that better methods to tackle this optimization problem would allow learning bilingual word embeddings without any bilingual evidence at all and, in this regard, we believe that our work opens exciting opportunities for future research.", 
        "184": "6 Error analysis  So as to better understand the behavior of our system, we performed an error analysis of its output in English-Italian bilingual lexicon induction when starting with the 5,000 entry, the 25 entry and the numeral dictionaries in comparison with the baseline method of Artetxe et al.", 
        "185": "(2016) with the 5,000 entry dictionary.", 
        "186": "For that purpose, we took 100 random examples from the test set in the [1-5K] frequency bin, another 100 from the [5K20K] frequency bin and 30 from the [100K-200K] frequency bin, and manually analyzed each of the errors made by all the 4 different variants.", 
        "187": "Our analysis first reveals that, in all the cases, about a third of the translations taken as erroneous according to the gold standard are not so in real-\nity.", 
        "188": "This corresponds to both different morphological variants of the gold standard translations (e.g.", 
        "189": "dichiarato/dichiaro\u0300) and other valid translations that were missing in the gold standard (e.g.", 
        "190": "climb \u2192 salita instead of the gold standard scalato).", 
        "191": "This phenomenon is considerably more pronounced in the first frequency bins, which already have a much higher accuracy according to the gold standard.", 
        "192": "As for the actual errors, we observe that nearly a third of them correspond to named entities for all the different variants.", 
        "193": "Interestingly, the vast majority of the proposed translations in these cases are also named entities (e.g.", 
        "194": "Ryan\u2192 Jason, John\u2192 Paolo), which are often highly related to the original ones (e.g.", 
        "195": "Volvo\u2192 BMW, Olympus\u2192 Nikon).", 
        "196": "While these are clear errors, it is understandable that these methods are unable to discriminate between named entities to this degree based solely on the distributional hypothesis, in particular when it comes to common proper names (e.g.", 
        "197": "John, Andy), and one could design alternative strategies to address this issue like taking the edit distance as an additional signal.", 
        "198": "For the remaining errors, all systems tend to propose translations that have some degree of relationship with the correct ones, including nearsynonyms (e.g.", 
        "199": "guidelines \u2192 raccomandazioni), antonyms (e.g.", 
        "200": "sender\u2192 destinatario) and words in the same semantic field (e.g.", 
        "201": "nominalism\u2192 intuizionismo / innatismo, which are all philosophical doctrines).", 
        "202": "However, there are also a few instances where the relationship is weak or unclear (e.g.", 
        "203": "loch\u2192 giardini, sweep\u2192 serrare).", 
        "204": "We also observe a few errors that are related to multiwords or collocations (e.g.", 
        "205": "carrier\u2192 aereo, presumably related to the multiword air carrier / linea aerea), as well as some rare word that is repeated across many translations (Ferruzzi), which could be attributed to the hubness problem (Dinu et al., 2015; Lazaridou et al., 2015).", 
        "206": "All in all, our error analysis reveals that the baseline method of Artetxe et al.", 
        "207": "(2016) and the proposed algorithm tend to make the same kind of errors regardless of the seed dictionary used by the latter, which reinforces our interpretation in the previous section regarding an underlying optimization objective that is independent from any training dictionary.", 
        "208": "Moreover, it shows that the quality of the learned mappings is much better than what the raw accuracy numbers might sug-\ngest, encouraging the incorporation of these techniques in other applications.", 
        "209": "7 Conclusions and future work  In this work, we propose a simple self-learning framework to learn bilingual word embedding mappings in combination with any embedding mapping and dictionary induction technique.", 
        "210": "Our experiments on bilingual lexicon induction and crosslingual word similarity show that our method is able to learn high quality bilingual embeddings from as little bilingual evidence as a 25 word dictionary or an automatically generated list of numerals, obtaining results that are competitive with state-of-the-art systems using much richer bilingual resources like larger dictionaries or parallel corpora.", 
        "211": "In spite of its simplicity, a more detailed analysis shows that our method is implicitly optimizing a meaningful objective function that is independent from any bilingual data which, with a better optimization method, might allow to learn bilingual word embeddings in a completely unsupervised manner.", 
        "212": "In the future, we would like to delve deeper into this direction and fine-tune our method so it can reliably learn high quality bilingual word embeddings without any bilingual evidence at all.", 
        "213": "In addition to that, we would like to explore non-linear transformations (Lu et al., 2015) and alternative dictionary induction methods (Dinu et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2017).", 
        "214": "Finally, we would like to apply our model in the decipherment scenario (Dou et al., 2015).",

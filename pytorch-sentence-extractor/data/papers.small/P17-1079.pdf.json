        "5": "However, none of these previous methods simultaneously satisfies the following desiderata, all of which, we argue, are desirable for practical use in NMT systems:\nMemory efficiency: The method should not require large memory to store the parameters and calculated vectors to maintain scalability in resource-constrained environments.", 
        "6": "Time efficiency: The method should be able to train the parameters efficiently, and possible to perform decoding efficiently with choosing the candidate words from the full probability distribution.",

        "9": "In this paper, we propose a method that satisfies all of these conditions: requires significantly less memory, fast, and is easy to implement minibatched on GPUs.", 
        "10": "The method works by not predicting a softmax over the entire output vocab-\n850\nulary, but instead by encoding each vocabulary word as a vector of binary variables, then independently predicting the bits of this binary representation.", 
        "11": "In order to represent a vocabulary size of 2n, the binary representation need only be at least n bits long, and thus the amount of computation and size of parameters required to select an output word is only O(log V ) in the size of the vocabulary V , a great reduction from the standard linear increase of O(V ) seen in the original softmax.",

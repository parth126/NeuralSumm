        "130": "Ideally, objective measures should be based on an assessment of improvements in the revised drafts; since we do not have evaluative data at this time, we approximate the degree of improvement using the number of revisions, since these two quantities were demonstrated to be positively correlated (Zhang and Litman, 2015).",

        "146": "As we did not observe a significant difference in the number of revisions made by the two interface groups, we cannot verify that H1 is true; possibly a larger pool of participants is needed, or possibly the writing assignment is not extensive enough (in length and in the number of drafts).", 
        "147": "Another possible explanation is that the system might only motivate the users to make more revisions when the feedback is different from the user\u2019s intention.",

        "157": "Both findings are consistent with H2, suggesting that participants will revise further if they perceive that their intended revisions were not recognized.",

        "165": "Finally, in the L2 group, there is a significant negative correlation between the number of surface revisions in Rev12 and the ratings for the statement \u201cthe system helps me to recognize the weakness of my es-\n10content/surface revisions from Draft2 to Draft3\nsay\u201d (\u03c1=-.57 and p < .008).", 
        "166": "This shows that giving feedback to L2 speakers is less helpful when they make more surface revisions.", 
        "167": "These results are consistent with H3.", 
        "168": "Summary Our findings suggest that feedback on revisions do impact how students review and rewrite their drafts.", 
        "169": "However, there are many factors at play, including the interface design and the students\u2019 linguistic backgrounds.", 
        "170": "4.2 Automatic Revision Identification  Another use of the corpus is to serve as a gold standard for training and testing a revision purpose prediction component for use in an automatic revision analysis system.", 
        "171": "In the version of ArgRewrite evaluated earlier (Interface A), the manual annotation of revision purposes enabled the system to provide revision feedback to users, which motivated them to improve their writing (H2).", 
        "172": "Automatic argumentative revision purpose prediction has been previously investigated by Zhang and Litman (2015).", 
        "173": "They developed and reported the performance of a binary classifier for each individual revision category (1 for revisions of the category and 0 for the rest of all revisions) using features from prior research.", 
        "174": "The availability of our corpus makes it possible for researchers to replicate such methods and conduct further studies.", 
        "175": "4.2.1 Hypotheses  In this paper, we repeat the experiment of Zhang and Litman (2015) under different settings to investigate three new hypotheses that can now be investigated given the features of our corpus:\nH4.", 
        "176": "The method used in Zhang and Litman (2015) for high school writings is also useful for the writings of college students.", 
        "177": "H5.", 
        "178": "The same revision classification method works differently for first revision attempts and second revision attempts.", 
        "179": "H6.", 
        "180": "The revision classification model trained on L2 essays has a different preference from the model trained on native essays.", 
        "181": "4.2.2 Methodology  We followed the work of (Zhang and Litman, 2015), where unigram features (words) were used as the baseline and the SVM classifier was used.", 
        "182": "Besides unigrams, three groups of features used in revision analysis, argument mining and discourse analysis research were extracted (Location, Textual and Language) as in Table 6 (Bronner and\nMonz, 2012; Daxenberger and Gurevych, 2013; Burstein et al., 2001; Falakmasir et al., 2014).", 
        "183": "For H4, 10-fold (participant) cross-validation is conducted on all the essays in the corpus.", 
        "184": "Unweighted average F-score for each revision category is reported, using unigram features versus using all features.", 
        "185": "Zhang and Litman (2015) observed a significant improvement over the unigram baseline using all the features.", 
        "186": "If H4 is true, we should expect a similar improvement over the unigram baseline using our corpus.", 
        "187": "For H5, 10-fold cross-validation was conducted for the revisions from Draft1 to Draft2 and revisions from Draft2 to Draft3 separately.", 
        "188": "We compared the improvement ratio brought by the advanced features over the unigram baseline.", 
        "189": "For H6, we trained two classifiers separately with L2 and native essays with all the features.", 
        "190": "20 native participants were first randomly selected as the test data.", 
        "191": "Afterwards classifiers were trained separately using the 20 L2 participants\u2019 essays and the remaining 20 native participants\u2019 essays.", 
        "192": "We would expect that the performance of the two trained classifiers is different on the same test data.", 
        "193": "4.2.3 Results and Discussion  The first two rows of Table 7 support H4.", 
        "194": "We observe that the method (SVM + all features) used in Zhang and Litman (2015) significantly improves performance (compared to a unigram baseline) for half of the classification tasks, which is similar to Zhang and Litman\u2019s results on high school (primarily L1) writing.", 
        "195": "In our corpus, performance on Claim, Evidence, Rebuttal and Organization was not significantly better than the baseline, possibly due to the limited number of positive training samples for these categories (Table 5).", 
        "196": "For example, one reason that the performance in Table 7 for Evidence might be low is that there are less than 100 Evidence instances in Table 5.", 
        "197": "For H5, the four rows in the middle of Table 7 show the difference of the cross-validation results on first attempt revisions and second attempt revisions.", 
        "198": "The earlier results using all the revisions, versus now just using only Rev12 or Rev23 revisions are similar, which provides little support for H5.", 
        "199": "With one exception, the features proposed in Zhang and Litman (2015) could again significantly improve the performance over the unigram baseline, for the same set of categories as when using all the revisions.", 
        "200": "However, for the Conventions/Grammar/Spelling category, we did not ob-\nserve a significant improvement for revisions from Draft2 and Draft3.", 
        "201": "A possible explanation is that there is a bigger difference in the writers\u2019 rewriting behavior from Draft2 to Draft3, which increases the difficulty of prediction.", 
        "202": "The last two rows of Table 7 support H6.", 
        "203": "Interestingly, we observe a better performance on Warrant, General and Word Usage/Clarity with a classifier trained and tested using native essays.", 
        "204": "Perhaps essays of native speakers are more similar to each other when revised along these dimensions.", 
        "205": "For Conventions/Grammar/Spelling, in contrast, the classifier trained on L2 data yields a better performance on the same native test set.", 
        "206": "This may be because the L2 revisions usually include more spelling/grammar corrections.", 
        "207": "5 Conclusion and Future Work  We have presented a new corpus for writing comparison research.", 
        "208": "Currently the corpus focuses on essay revisions made by both native and L2 college students.", 
        "209": "In addition to three drafts of essays, we have analyzed the drafts to align semantically similar sentences and to assign revision purposes for each revised aligned sentence pair.", 
        "210": "We have also conducted two studies to demonstrate the use of the corpus for revision behavior analysis and for automatic revision purpose classification.", 
        "211": "While in this paper we explored language as\none factor influencing rewriting behavior, our corpus also contains information about other potential factors such as gender and education level which we plan to investigate in the future.", 
        "212": "We also plan to augment the corpus to support additional types of research on revision analysis.", 
        "213": "Some potential augmentations include more fine-grained revision categories, revision properties such as statement strength (Tan and Lee, 2014) and quality evaluations, and sub-sentential revision scopes.", 
        "214": "Acknowledgments  We want to thank Amanda Godley, Geeta Kothari, and the members of the ArgRewrite group (Reed Armstrong, Nicolo Manfredi and Tazin Afrin) for their helpful feedback and the anonymous reviewers for their suggestions.",

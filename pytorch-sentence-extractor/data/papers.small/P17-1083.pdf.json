        "159": "Both the vector average and the or-operator are swayed by large outliers, making them sensitive to ambiguous terms in an anchor facet.", 
        "160": "Element-wise min also has this robustness, but harmonic mean is also able to better characterize anchor facets as it has more centralizing tendency than the min.", 
        "161": "3.3 Runtime Considerations  Tandem anchors will enable users to direct topic inference to improve topic quality.", 
        "162": "However, for the algorithm to be interactive we must also consider runtime.", 
        "163": "Cook and Thomas (2005) argue that for interactive applications with user-initiated actions like ours the response time should be less than ten seconds.",

        "167": "Fortunately, the runtime of tandem anchors is amenable to interactive topic modeling.", 
        "168": "On 20NEWS, interactive updates take a median time of 2.13 seconds.", 
        "169": "This result was obtained using a single core of an AMD Phemon II X6 1090T processor.", 
        "170": "Furthermore, larger datasets typically have a sublinear increase in distinct word types, so we can expect to see similar run times, even on much larger datasets.", 
        "171": "Compared to other interactive topic modeling algorithms, tandem anchors has a very attractive run time.", 
        "172": "For example, using an optimized version of the sampler for the Interactive Topic Model described by Hu and Boyd-Graber (2012), and the recommended 30 iterations of sampling, the Interactive Topic Model updates with a median time of 24.8 seconds (Hu and Boyd-Graber, 2012), which is well beyond our desired update time for interactive use and an order of magnitude slower than tandem anchors.", 
        "173": "Another promising interactive topic modeling approach is Utopian (Choo et al., 2013), which uses non-negative factorization, albeit without the benefit of anchor words.", 
        "174": "Utopian is much slower than tandem anchors.", 
        "175": "Even on the small InfoVisVAST dataset which contains only 515 documents, Utopian takes 48 seconds to converge.", 
        "176": "While the times are not strictly comparable due to differing datasets, Utopian scales linearly with the size of the data, we can intuit that even for moderately sized datasets such as 20NEWS, Utopian is infeasible for interactive topic modeling due to run time.", 
        "177": "While each of these interactive topic modeling algorithms do achieve reasonable topics, only our algorithm fits the run time requirements for inter-\nactivity.", 
        "178": "Furthermore, since tandem anchors scales with the size of the vocabulary rather than the size of the data, this trend will only become more pronounced as we increase the amount of data.", 
        "179": "4 Interactive Anchor Words  Given high quality anchor facets, the tandem anchor algorithm can produce high quality topic models (particularly when the harmonic mean combiner is used).", 
        "180": "Moreover, the tandem anchor algorithm is fast enough to be interactive (as opposed to model-based approaches such as the Interactive Topic Model).",

        "182": "We compare both single word and tandem anchors in our study.", 
        "183": "We do not include the Interactive Topic Model or Utopian, as their run times are too slow for our users.", 
        "184": "4.1 Interface and User Study  To show that interactive tandem anchor words are fast, effective, and intuitive, we ask users to understand a dataset using the anchor word algorithm.", 
        "185": "For this user study, we recruit twenty participants drawn from a university student body.",

        "188": "None of the students had any prior familiarity with topic modeling or the 20NEWS dataset.",

        "190": "The left column allows users to view and edit topics\u2019 anchor words; the right column lists the most probable words in each topic.7 The user can remove an anchor word or drag words from\n7While we use topics generated using harmonic mean for our final analysis, users were shown topics generated using the min combiner.", 
        "191": "However, this does not change our result.", 
        "192": "the topic word lists (right column) to become an anchor word.", 
        "193": "Users can also add additional topics by clicking the \u201cAdd Anchor\u201d to create additional anchors.", 
        "194": "If the user wants to add a word to a tandem anchor set that does not appear in the interface, they manually type the word (restricted to the model\u2019s vocabulary).", 
        "195": "When the user wants to see the updated topics for their newly refined anchors, they click \u201cUpdate Topics\u201d.", 
        "196": "We give each a participant a high level overview of topic modeling.", 
        "197": "We also describe common problems with topic models including intruding topic words, duplicate topics, and ambiguous topics.", 
        "198": "Users are instructed to use their best judgement to determine if topics are useful.", 
        "199": "The task is to edit the anchor words to improve the topics.", 
        "200": "We asked that users spend at least twenty minutes, but no more than thirty minutes.", 
        "201": "We repeat the task twice: once with tandem anchors, and once with single word anchors.8  4.2 Quantitative Results  We now validate our main result that for interactive topic modeling, tandem anchors yields better topics than single word anchors.", 
        "202": "Like our titlebased experiments in Section 3, topics generated from users become features to train and test a classifier for the 20NEWS dataset.", 
        "203": "We choose this dataset for easier comparison with the Interactive Topic Modeling result of Hu et al.", 
        "204": "(2014).", 
        "205": "Basedsie on our results with title-based anchors, we use the harmonic mean combiner in our analysis.", 
        "206": "As before, we report not only accuracy, but also multiple clustering metrics using the confusion matrix from the classification task.", 
        "207": "Finally, we report topic coherence.", 
        "208": "Figure 3 summarizes the results of our quantitative evaluation.", 
        "209": "While we only compare user generated anchors in our analysis, we include the unsupervised Gram-Schmidt anchors as a baseline.", 
        "210": "Some of the data violate assumptions of normality.", 
        "211": "Therefore, we use Wilcoxon\u2019s signed-rank test (Wilcoxon, 1945) to determine if the differences between multiword anchors and single word anchors are significant.", 
        "212": "Topics from user generated multiword anchors yield higher classification accuracy (Figure 3).", 
        "213": "Not only is our approach more scalable than the Interactive Topic Model, but we also achieve\n8The order in which users complete these tasks is counterbalanced.", 
        "214": "higher classification accuracy than Hu et al.", 
        "215": "(2014).9 Tandem anchors also improve clustering metrics.10\nWhile user selected tandem anchors produce better classification features than single word anchors, users selected single word anchors produce topics with similar topic coherence scores.11\nTo understand this phenomenon, we use quality metrics (AlSumait et al., 2009) for ranking topics by their correspondence to genuine themes in the data.", 
        "216": "Significant topics are likely skewed towards a few related words, so we measure the distance of each topic-word distribution from the uniform distribution over words.", 
        "217": "Topics which are close to the underlying word distribution of the entire data are likely to be vacuous, so we also measure the distance of each topic-word distribution from the underlying word distribution.", 
        "218": "Finally, background topics are likely to appear in a wide range of documents, while meaningful topics will appear in a smaller subset of the data.", 
        "219": "Figure 4 reports our topic significance findings.", 
        "220": "For all three significance metrics, multiword anchors produce more significant topics than single word anchors.10 Topic coherence is based solely on the top n words of a topic, while both accuracy and topic significance depend on the entire topicword distributions.",

        "230": "multiword anchors make it easier to merge similar topics into a single focused topic by combining anchors.", 
        "231": "For example, by combining multiple words related to Christianity, users were able to create a topic which is highly specific, and differentiated from general religion themes which included terms about Atheism and Judaism.", 
        "232": "While users find that use tandem anchors is easier, only 55% of our users say that they prefer the final topics produced by tandem anchors compared to single word anchors.", 
        "233": "This is in harmony with our quantitative measurements of topic coherence, and may be the result of our stopping criteria: when users judged the topics to be useful.", 
        "234": "However, 100% of our users feel that the topics created through interaction were better than those generated from Gram-Schmidt anchors.", 
        "235": "This was true regardless of whether we used tandem anchors or single word anchors.", 
        "236": "Our participants also produce fewer topics when using multiword anchors.", 
        "237": "The mean difference between topics under single word anchors and multiple word anchors is 9.35.", 
        "238": "In follow up interviews, participants indicate that the easiest way to resolve an ambiguous topic with single word anchors was to create a new anchor for each of the ambiguous terms, thus explaining the proliferation of topics for single word anchors.", 
        "239": "In contrast, fixing an ambiguous tandem anchor is simple: users just add more terms to the anchor facet.", 
        "240": "5 Conclusion  Tandem anchors extend the anchor words algorithm to allow multiple words to be combined into anchor facets.", 
        "241": "For interactive topic modeling, using anchor facets in place of single word anchors produces higher quality topic models and are more intuitive to use.", 
        "242": "Furthermore, our approach scales much better than existing interactive topic modeling techniques, allowing interactivity on large\ndatasets for which interactivity was previous impossible.",

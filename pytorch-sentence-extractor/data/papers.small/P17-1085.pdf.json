        "2": "There are several NLP tasks such as fine-grained opinion mining (Choi et al., 2006), semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), etc., which have a similar structure; thus making it an important and a challenging task.", 
        "3": "Several methods have been proposed for entity mention and relation extraction at the sentencelevel.", 
        "4": "These can be broadly categorized into \u2013 1) pipeline models that treat the identification of entity mentions (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007) and relation classification (Zhou et al., 2005) as two separate tasks; and 2) joint models, also the more\nrecent, which simultaneously identify the entity mention and relations (Li and Ji, 2014; Miwa and Sasaki, 2014).", 
        "5": "Joint models have been argued to perform better than the pipeline models as knowledge of the typed relation can increase the confidence of the model on entity extraction and vice versa.", 
        "6": "Recurrent networks (RNNs) (Elman, 1990) have recently become very popular for sequence tagging tasks such as entity extraction that involves a set of contiguous tokens.",

        "8": "For these tasks, RNNs that make use of tree structures have been deemed more suitable.", 
        "9": "Miwa and Bansal (2016), for example, propose an RNN comprised of a sequencebased long short term memory (LSTM) for entity identification and a separate tree-based dependency LSTM layer for relation classification using shared parameters between the two components.",

        "60": "3.1 Multi-layer Bi-directional Recurrent Network  We use multi-layer bi-directional LSTMs for sequence tagging because LSTMs are more capable of capturing long-term dependencies between tokens, making it ideal for both entity mention and\nrelation extraction.",

        "82": "We can extend our approach to output multiple relations as explained in Section 4.",

        "84": "At each time step, we stack the top hidden layer representations from the previous time steps z\u2264t2 and its corresponding label embeddings b\u2264t.", 
        "85": "We only stack the top hidden layer representations for the tokens which were predicted as non-O\u2019s for previous time steps as shown in Figure 2.", 
        "86": "Our decoding representation at time t is the concatenation of zt and bt.", 
        "87": "The attention probabilities can now be computed as below:\nut\u2264t = v T tanh(W1[z\u2264t; b\u2264t] +W2[zt; bt]) pt\u2264t = softmax(u t \u2264t)\nThus, pt\u2264t corresponds to the probability of each token, in the sequence so far, being related to the current token at time step t. For the case of NONE relations, the token at t is related to itself.", 
        "88": "We also want to find the type of the relations.", 
        "89": "In order to achieve this, we add an extra dimension to v corresponding to the size of relation types R space.",

        "93": "Also, Sutskever et al.", 
        "94": "(2014) found that their performance on machine translation task improved on reversing the input sentences during training.", 
        "95": "Inspired by these developments, we experiment with bi-directional encoding at the output layer.", 
        "96": "We add another top hidden layer on Bi-LSTM in Figure 2 which encodes the output sequence from rightto-left.", 
        "97": "The two encoding share the same multilayer bi-directional LSTM except for the top hidden layer.", 
        "98": "Thus, we have two output layers in our network which output the entity tags and relation tags separately.", 
        "99": "At inference time, we employ heuristics to combine the output from the two directions.", 
        "100": "2The notation \u2264 is used to denote the stacking of the representations from the previous time steps.", 
        "101": "Thus, if zt is a 2-dimensional matrix then z\u2264t will be a 3-dimensional tensor.", 
        "102": "The size along the first dimension will now correspond to the number of 2-dimensional matrices stacked.", 
        "103": "4 Training  We train our network by maximizing the logprobability of the correct entity E and relation R tag sequences jointly given the sentence S as below:\nlog p(E,R|S, \u03b8)\n= 1 |S| \u2211\ni\u2208|S| log p(ei, ri|e<i, r<i, S, \u03b8)\n= 1 |S| \u2211\ni\u2208|S| log p(ei|e<i, r<i) + log p(ri|e\u2264i, r<i)\nThus, we can decompose our objective into the sum of log-probabilities over entity sequence and relation sequence.", 
        "104": "We use the gold entity tags while training.", 
        "105": "As shown in Figure 2, we input the label embedding from the previous time step to the top hidden layer at the current time step along with the other recurrent inputs.", 
        "106": "During training, we pass the gold label embedding to the next time step which enables better training of our model.", 
        "107": "However, at test time when the gold label is not available we use the predicted label at previous time step as input to the current step.", 
        "108": "At inference time, we can greedily decode the sequence to find the most likely entity E\u0302 and relation R\u0302 tag sequences:\n(E\u0302, R\u0302) = argmax E,R p(E,R)\nSince, we add another top layer to encode tag sequences in the reverse order as explained in Section 3.5, there may be conflicts in the output.", 
        "109": "We select the positive and more confident label similar to Miwa and Bansal (2016).", 
        "110": "Multiple Relations Our approach to relation extraction is different from Miwa and Bansal (2016).", 
        "111": "Miwa and Bansal (2016) present each pair of entities to their model for relation classification.", 
        "112": "In our approach, we use pointer networks to identify the related entities.", 
        "113": "Thus, for our approach described so far if we only compute the argmax on our objective then we limit our model to output only one relation label per token.", 
        "114": "However, from our analysis of the dataset, an entity may be related to more than one entity in the sentence.", 
        "115": "Hence, we modify our objective to include multiple relations.", 
        "116": "In Figure 2, token \u201cSafwan\u201d is related to both tokens \u201cMartin\u201d and \u201cGeissler\u201d of the entity \u201cMartin Geissler\u201d, hence we assign probability of 0.5\nto both these tokens.", 
        "117": "This can be easily expanded to include tokens from other related entities, such that we assign equal probability 1N to all tokens 3 depending on the number N of these related tokens.", 
        "118": "The log-probability for the entity part remain the same as in our objective discussed in Section 4, however we modify the relation log-probability as below:\n\u2211\n|j:r\u2032i,j>0|\nr \u2032 i,j log p(ri,j|e\u2264i, r<i, S, \u03b8)\nwhere, r \u2032 i is the true distribution over relation label space and ri is the softmax output from our model.", 
        "119": "From empirical analysis, we find that r\n\u2032 i is\ngenerally sparse and hence using a cross entropy objective like this can be useful to find multiple relations.", 
        "120": "We can also use Sparsemax (Martins and Astudillo, 2016) instead of softmax which is more suitable for sparse distributions.", 
        "121": "However, we leave it for future work.",

        "154": "All the weights in the network are initialized from small random uniform noise.", 
        "155": "We tune our hyperparameters based on ACE05 development set and use them for training on ACE04 dataset.", 
        "156": "6 Results  Table 1 compares the performance of our system with respect to the baselines on ACE05 dataset.", 
        "157": "We find that our joint model significantly outperforms the joint structured perceptron model (Li and Ji, 2014) on both entities and relations, despite the unavailability of features such as dependency trees, POS tags, etc.", 
        "158": "However, if we compare our model to the SPTree models, then we find that their model has better recall on both entities and relations.", 
        "159": "In Section 7, we perform error analysis to understand the difference in the performance of the two models in detail.", 
        "160": "We also compare the performance of various encoding schemes in Table 2.", 
        "161": "We compare the benefits of introducing multiple relations in our objective and bi-directional encoding compared to leftto-right encoding.", 
        "162": "Multiple Relations We find that modifying our objective to include multiple relations improves the recall of our system on relations, leading to slight improvement on the overall performance on\nrelations.", 
        "163": "However, careful tuning of the threshold may further improve precision.", 
        "164": "Bi-directional Encoding By adding bidirectional encoding to our system, we find that we can significantly improve the performance of our system compared to left-to-right encoding.", 
        "165": "It also improves precision compared to left-toright decoding combined with multiple relations objective.", 
        "166": "We find that for some relations it is easier to detect them with respect to one of the entities in the entity pair.", 
        "167": "PHYS relation is easier identified with respect to GPE entity than PER entity.", 
        "168": "Thus, our bi-directional encoding of relations allows us to encode these relations with respect to both entities in the relation.", 
        "169": "Table 3 shows the performance of our model on ACE04 dataset.", 
        "170": "We believe that tuning the hyperparameters of our model can further improve the results on this dataset.", 
        "171": "As also pointed out by Li and Ji (2014) that ACE05 has better annotation quality, we focused on ACE05 dataset for this work.", 
        "172": "7 Error Analysis  In this section, we perform a fine-grained comparison of our model with respect to the SPTree (Miwa and Bansal, 2016) model.", 
        "173": "We compare the performance of the two models with respect to entities, relation types and the distance between the relation arguments and provide examples from the test set in Table 6.", 
        "174": "7.1 Entities  We find that our model has lower recall on entity extraction than SPTree as shown in Table 1.", 
        "175": "Miwa and Bansal (2016), in one of the ablation tests on ACE05 development set, show that their model can gain upto 2% improvement in recall by entity pretraining.", 
        "176": "Since we propose a jointmodel, we cannot directly apply their pretraining trick on entities separately.", 
        "177": "We leave it for future work.", 
        "178": "Li and Ji (2014) mentioned in their analysis of the dataset that there were many \u201cUNK\u201d tokens in the test set which were never seen during training.", 
        "179": "We verified the same and we hypothesize that for this reason the performance on the entities depends largely on the pretrained word embeddings being used.", 
        "180": "We found considerable improvements on entity recall when using pretrained word embeddings, if available, for these \u201cUNK\u201d tokens.", 
        "181": "Miwa and Bansal (2016) also use additional features such as POS tags in addition to pretrained word embeddings at the input layer.", 
        "182": "7.2 Relation Types  We evaluate our model on different relation types and compare the performance with SPTree model\nin Table 4.", 
        "183": "Interestingly, we find that the performance of the two models is varied over different relation types.", 
        "184": "The dependency tree-based model significantly outperforms our joint-model on PHYS and PART-WHOLE relations, whereas our model is significantly better than tree-based model on ART relation.", 
        "185": "We show an example sentence (S1) in Table 6, where SPTree model identifies the entities in ART relation correctly but fails to identify ART relation.", 
        "186": "We compare the performance with respect to PHYS relation in Section 7.3.", 
        "187": "7.3 Distance-based Analysis  We also compare the performance of the two models on relations based on the distance between the entities in a relation in Table 5.", 
        "188": "We find that the performance of both the models is very low for distance greater than 7.", 
        "189": "SPTree model can identify 36 relations out of 131 such relations correctly, while our model can only identify 20 relations in this category.", 
        "190": "We manually compare the output of the two systems on these cases on several examples to understand the gain of using dependency tree on longer distances.", 
        "191": "Interestingly, the majority of these relations belong to PHYS type, thus resulting in lower performance on PHYS as discussed in Section 7.2.", 
        "192": "We found that there were a few instances of co-reference errors as shown in S2 in Table 6.", 
        "193": "Our model identifies a PHYS relation between \u201chere\u201d and \u201cbaghdad\u201d, whereas the gold annotation has PHYS relation between \u201clocation\u201d and \u201cbaghdad\u201d.", 
        "194": "We think that\nincorporating these co-reference information during both training and evaluation will further improve the performance of both systems.", 
        "195": "Another source of error that we found was the inability of our system to extract entities (lower recall) as in S3.", 
        "196": "Our model could not identify the FAC entity \u201cresidence\u201d.", 
        "197": "Hence, we think an improvement on entity performance via methods like pretraining might be helpful in identifying more relations.", 
        "198": "For distance less than 7, we find that our model has better recall but lower precision, as expected.", 
        "199": "8 Conclusion  In this paper, we propose a novel attention-based LSTM model for joint extraction of entity mentions and relations.", 
        "200": "Experimentally, we found that our model significantly outperforms feature-rich structured perceptron joint model by Li and Ji (2014).", 
        "201": "We also compare our model to an endto-end LSTM model by Miwa and Bansal (2016) which comprises of a sequence layer for entity extraction and a tree-based dependency layer for relation classification.", 
        "202": "We find that our model, without access to dependency trees, POS tags, etc performs within 1% on entities and 2% on relations on ACE05 dataset.", 
        "203": "We also find that our model performs significantly better than their treebased model on the ART relation, while their treebased model performs better on PHYS and PARTWHOLE relations; the two models perform com-\nparably on all other relation types.", 
        "204": "In future, we plan to explore pretraining methods for our model which were shown to improve recall on entity and relation performance by Miwa and Bansal (2016).", 
        "205": "We introduce bi-directional output encoding as well as an objective to learn multiple relations in this paper.", 
        "206": "However, this presents the challenge of combining predictions from the two directions.", 
        "207": "We use heuristics in this paper to combine the predictions.", 
        "208": "We think that using probabilistic methods to combine model predictions from both directions may further improve the performance.", 
        "209": "We also plan to use Sparsemax (Martins and Astudillo, 2016) instead of Softmax for multiple relations, as the former is more suitable for multi-label classification for sparse labels.", 
        "210": "It would also be interesting to see the effect of reranking (Collins and Koo, 2005) on our joint model.", 
        "211": "We also plan to extend the identification of entities to full entity mention span instead of only the head phrase as in Lu and Roth (2015).", 
        "212": "Acknowledgments  We thank Qi Li and Makoto Miwa for their help with the dataset and sharing their code for analysis.", 
        "213": "We also thank Xilun Chen, Xanda Schofield, Yiqing Hua, Vlad Niculae, Tianze Shi and the three anonymous reviewers for their helpful feedback and discussion."

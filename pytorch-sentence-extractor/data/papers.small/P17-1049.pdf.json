        "44": "We thus refer to translations into English as direct, while translations into all other languages, via English as a third language, are indirect.", 
        "45": "We hypothesize that indirect translation will obscure the markers of the original language in the final translation.", 
        "46": "Nevertheless, we expect (weakened) fingerprints of the source language to be identifiable in the target despite the pivot, presumably resulting in somewhat poorer phylogenetic trees.", 
        "47": "We focus on 17 source languages, grouped into 3 language families: Germanic, Romance, and Balto-Slavic.2 These include translations to English and to French from Bulgarian (BG), Czech (CS), Danish (DA), Dutch (NL), English (EN), French (FR), German (DE), Italian (IT), Latvian (LV), Lithuanian (LT), Polish (PL), Portuguese (PT), Romanian (RO), Slovak (SK), Slovenian (SL), Spanish (ES), and Swedish (SV).", 
        "48": "We also included texts written originally in English and French.", 
        "49": "All datasets were split on sentence boundary, cleaned (empty lines removed), tokenized, and annotated for part-of-speech (POS) using the Stanford tools (Manning et al., 2014).", 
        "50": "In all the tree reconstruction experiments, we sampled equal-sized chunks from each source language, using as much data as available for all languages.", 
        "51": "This yielded 27, 000 tokens from translations to English, and 30, 000 tokens from translations into French.", 
        "52": "1The common practice is that one translates into one\u2019s native language; in particular, this practice is strictly imposed in the EU parliament where a translator must have perfect proficiency in the target language, meeting very high standards of accuracy.",

        "54": "3.2 Features  Following standard practice (Volansky et al., 2015; Rabinovich and Wintner, 2015), we represented both original and translated texts as feature vectors, where the choice of features determines the extent to which we expect sourcelanguage interference to be present in the translation product.", 
        "55": "Crucially, the features abstract away from the contents of the texts and focus on their structure, reflecting, among other things, morphological and syntactic patterns.",

        "81": "All feature values were normalized to a zero-one scale prior to clustering.", 
        "82": "3.4 Evaluation methodology  To evaluate the quality of the trees we generate, we compute their similarity to the gold standard via two metrics: unweighted, assessing only structural (topological) similarity, and weighted, estimating similarity based on both structure and branching length.", 
        "83": "Several methods have been proposed for evaluating the quality of phylogenetic language trees (Pompei et al., 2011; Wichmann and Grant, 2012; Nouri and Yangarber, 2016).", 
        "84": "A popular metric is the Robinson-Foulds (RF) methodology (Robinson and Foulds, 1981), which is based on the symmetric difference in the number of bi-partitions, the ways in which an edge can split the leaves of a tree into two sets.", 
        "85": "The distance between two trees is then defined as the number of splits induced by one of the trees, but not the other.", 
        "86": "Despite its popularity, the RF metric has well-known shortcomings; for example, relocating a single leaf can result in a tree maximally distant from the original one (Bo\u0308cker et al., 2013).", 
        "87": "Additional methodologies for evaluating phylogenetic trees include branch score distance (Kuhner and Felsenstein, 1994), enhancing RF with branch lengths, purity score (Heller and Ghahramani, 2005), and subtree score (Teh et al., 2009).", 
        "88": "The latter two ignore branch lengths and only consider structural similarities for evaluation.", 
        "89": "We opted for a simple yet powerful adaptation of the L2-norm to leaf-pair distance, inherently suitable for both unweighted and weighted evaluation.", 
        "90": "Given a tree of N leaves, li, i \u2208 [1..N ], the weighted distance between two leaves li, lj in a tree \u03c4 , denotedD\u03c4 (li, lj), is the sum of the weights of all edges on the shortest path between li and lj .", 
        "91": "The unweighted distance sums up the number of the edges in this path (i.e., all weights are equal to 1).", 
        "92": "The distance Dist(\u03c4, g) between a generated tree \u03c4 and the gold tree g is then calculated by summing the square differences between all leafpair distances (whether weighted or unweighted) in the two trees: Dist(\u03c4, g) = \u2211\ni,j\u2208[1..N ];i 6=j (D\u03c4 (li, lj)\u2212Dg(li, lj))2  4 Detection of Translations and their Source Language    4.1 Identification of translation  We first reconfirmed that originals and translations are easily separable, extending results of supervised classification of O vs. T (where O refers to original English texts, and T to translated English) (Baroni and Bernardini, 2006; van Halteren, 2008; Volansky et al., 2015) to the 16 original languages considered in this work.", 
        "93": "We also conducted similar experiments with French originals and translations.", 
        "94": "We used 200 chunks of approximately 2K\ntokens (respecting sentence boundaries) from both O and T, and normalized the values of lexical features by the number of tokens in each chunk.", 
        "95": "For classification, we used Platt\u2019s sequential minimal optimization algorithm (Keerthi et al., 2001; Hall et al., 2009) to train support vector machine classifiers with the default linear kernel.", 
        "96": "We evaluated the results with 10-fold cross-validation.", 
        "97": "Table 1 presents the classification accuracy of (English and French) O vs. T using each feature set.", 
        "98": "In line with previous works (Ilisei et al., 2010; Volansky et al., 2015; Rabinovich and Wintner, 2015), the binary classification results are highly accurate, achieving over 95% accuracy using POS-trigrams and function words for both English and French, and above 85% using cohesive markers.", 
        "99": "4.2 Identification of source language  Identifying the source language of translated texts is a task in which machines clearly outperform humans (Baroni and Bernardini, 2006).", 
        "100": "Koppel and Ordan (2011) performed 5-way classification of texts translated from Italian, French, Spanish, German, and Finnish, achieving an accuracy of 92.7%.", 
        "101": "Furthermore, misclassified instances were more frequently assigned to genetically related languages.", 
        "102": "We extended this experiment to 14 languages representing 3 language families (the number of languages was limited by the amount of data available).", 
        "103": "We extracted 100 chunks of 1,000 tokens each from each source language and classified the translated English (and, separately, French) texts into 14 classes using the best performing POStrigrams feature set.", 
        "104": "Cross-validation evaluation yielded an accuracy of 75.61% on English translations (note that the baseline is 100/14 = 7.14%).", 
        "105": "The corresponding confusion matrix, presented in Figure 2 (left), reveals interesting phenomena: much of the confusion resides within language families, framed by the bold line in the figure.", 
        "106": "For example, instances of Germanic languages are almost perfectly classified as Germanic, with only\na few chunks assigned to other language families.", 
        "107": "The evident intra-family linguistic ties exposed by this experiment support the intuition that cross-linguistic transfer in translation is governed by typological properties of the source language.", 
        "108": "That is, translations from related sources tend to resemble each other to a greater extent than translations from more distant languages.", 
        "109": "This observation is further supported by the evaluation of a three-way classification task, where the goal is to only identify the language family (Germanic, Romance, or Balto-Slavic): the accuracy of this task is 90.62%.", 
        "110": "Note also that the mis-classified instances of both Romance and Germanic languages are nearly never attributed to Balto-Slavic languages, since Germanic and Romance are much closer to each other than to BaltoSlavic.", 
        "111": "Figure 2 (right) displays a similar confusion matrix, the only difference being that French translations are classified.", 
        "112": "We attribute the lower cross-validation accuracy (48.92%, reflected also by the lower number of correctly assigned instances on the matrix diagonal, compared to English) to the intervention of the pivot language in the translation process.", 
        "113": "Nevertheless, the confusion is still mainly constrained to intra-family boundaries.", 
        "114": "5 Reconstruction of Phylogenetic Language Trees    5.1 Reconstructing language typology  Inspired by the results reported in Section 4.2, we generated phylogenetic language trees from both English and French texts translated from the other European languages.", 
        "115": "We hypothesized that interference from the source language was present in the translation product to an extent that would facilitate the construction of a tree sufficiently similar to the gold IE tree (Figure 1).", 
        "116": "The best trees, those closest to the gold standard, were generated using POS-trigrams: these are the features that are most closely associated with source-language interference (see Section 3.2).", 
        "117": "Figure 3 depicts the trees produced from English and French translations using POStrigrams.", 
        "118": "Both trees reasonably group individual languages into three language-family branches.", 
        "119": "In particular, they cluster the Germanic and Romance languages closer than the Balto-Slavic.", 
        "120": "Capturing the more subtle intra-family ties turned out to be\nmore challenging, although English outperformed its French counterpart on this task by almost perfectly reconstructing the Germanic sub-tree.", 
        "121": "We repeated the clustering experiments with various feature sets.", 
        "122": "For each feature set, we randomly sampled equally-sized subsets of the dataset (translated from each of the source languages), represented the data as feature vectors, generated a tree by clustering the feature vectors, and then computed the weighted and unweighted distances between the generated tree and the gold standard.", 
        "123": "We repeated this procedure 50 times for each feature set, and then averaged the resulting distances.",

        "132": "This corroborates our hypothesis that this feature set carries over interference of the source language to a considerable extent (see Section 1).", 
        "133": "Furthermore, function words achieve more moderate results, but still much better than random.", 
        "134": "This reflects the fact that these features carry over some grammatical constructs of the source language into the translation product.", 
        "135": "Finally, in all cases, the least accurate tree, nearly random, is produced by cohesive markers; this is an evidence that this feature is sourcelanguage agnostic and reflects the universal effect of explicitation (see Section 3.2).", 
        "136": "While cohesive markers are a good indicator of translations, they reflect properties that are not indicative of the source language.", 
        "137": "The combination of POS-trigrams and FW yields the best tree in three out of four cases, implying that these feature sets capture different, complementary aspects of the source-language interference.", 
        "138": "Surprisingly, reasonably good trees were also generated from French translations; yet, these trees are systematically worse than their English counterparts.", 
        "139": "The original signal of the source language is distorted twice: first via a Germanic language (English) and then via a Romance language (French).", 
        "140": "However, the signal is strong enough to\nyield a clear phylogenetic tree of the source languages.", 
        "141": "Interference is thus revealed to be an extremely powerful force, partially resistant to intermediate distortions.", 
        "142": "6 Analysis  We demonstrated that source-language traces are dominant in translation products to an extent that facilitates reconstruction of the history of the source languages.", 
        "143": "We now inspect some of these phenomena in more detail to better understand the prominent characteristics of interference.", 
        "144": "For each phenomenon, we computed the frequencies of patterns that reflect it in texts translated to English from each individual language, and averaged the measures over each language family (Germanic, Romance, and Balto-Slavic).",

        "148": "However, many languages only have definite articles and some only have indefinite articles.", 
        "149": "Romance languages, and in particular the five Romance languages of our dataset, have definite articles that can sometimes be omitted, but not as commonly as in English.", 
        "150": "Balto-Slavic languages typically do not have any articles.", 
        "151": "Mastering the use of articles in English is notoriously hard, leading to errors in non-native speakers (Han et al., 2006).", 
        "152": "For example, native speakers of Slavic languages tend to overuse definite articles in German (Hirschmann et al., 2013).", 
        "153": "Similarly, we expect translations from Balto-Slavic languages to overuse \u2018the\u2019.", 
        "154": "We computed the frequencies of \u2018the\u2019 in translations to English from each of the three language families.", 
        "155": "The results show a significant overuse of \u2018the\u2019 in translations from Balto-Slavic languages, and some overuse in translations from Romance languages.", 
        "156": "6.2 Possessive constructions  Languages also vary in the way they mark possession.", 
        "157": "English marks it in three ways: with the clitic \u2018\u2019s\u2019 (\u2018the guest\u2019s room\u2019 ), with a prepositional phrase containing \u2018of\u2019 (\u2018the room of the guest\u2019 ), and, like in other Germanic languages, with noun compounds (\u2018guest room\u2019 ).", 
        "158": "Compounds are considerably less frequent in Romance languages\n(Swan and Smith, 2001); Balto-Slavic indicates possession using case-marking.", 
        "159": "Languages also vary with respect to whether or not possession is head-marked.", 
        "160": "In Balto-Slavic languages, the genitive case is head-marked, which reverses the order of the two nouns with respect to the common English \u2018\u2019s\u2019 construction.", 
        "161": "Since copying word order, if possible across languages, is one of the major features of interference (Eetemadi and Toutanova, 2014), we anticipated that Balto-Slavic languages will exhibit the highest rate of noun-\u2018of\u2019 -NP constructions.", 
        "162": "This would be followed by Romance languages, in which this construction is highly common, and then by Germanic languages, where noun compounds can often be copied as such.", 
        "163": "The results are consistent with our expectations.", 
        "164": "6.3 Verb-particle constructions  Verb-particle constructions (e.g., \u2018turn down\u2019 ) consist of verbs that combine with a particle to create a new meaning (Dehe\u0301 et al., 2002).", 
        "165": "Such constructions are much more common in Germanic languages (Iacobini and Masini, 2005), hence we expect to encounter their equivalents in English translations more frequently.", 
        "166": "We computed the frequencies of these constructions in the data; the results show a clear overuse of verb-particle constructions in translations from Germanic, and an underuse of such constructions in translations from Balto-Slavic.", 
        "167": "6.4 Tense and aspect  Tense and aspect are expressed in different ways across languages.", 
        "168": "English, like other Germanic languages, uses a full system of aspectual distinctions, expressed via perfect and progressive forms (with the auxiliary verbs \u2018have\u2019 or \u2018be\u2019 ).", 
        "169": "Balto-Slavic, in contrast, has no such system, and the distinction is marked lexically, by having two\ntypes of verbs.", 
        "170": "Romance languages are in between, with both lexical and grammatical distinctions.", 
        "171": "We computed the frequencies of perfect forms (defined as the auxiliary \u2018have\u2019 followed by the past participle form), and the progressive forms (defined as the auxiliary \u2018be\u2019 plus a present participle form).", 
        "172": "Indeed, Germanic overuses the perfect aspect significantly; the use of the progressive aspect also varies across language families, exhibiting the lowest frequency in translations from Balto-Slavic.", 
        "173": "7 Conclusion  Translations may be considered distortions of the original text, but this distortion is far from random.", 
        "174": "It depicts a very clear picture, reflecting language typology to the extent that disregarding the sources altogether, a phylogenetic tree can be reconstructed from a monolingual corpus consisting of multiple translations.", 
        "175": "This holds for the product of highly professional translators, who conform to a common standard, and whose products are edited by native speakers, like themselves.", 
        "176": "It even holds after two phases of translations.", 
        "177": "We are presently trying to extend these results to translations in a different domain (literary texts) into a very different language (Hebrew).", 
        "178": "Postulated universals in linguistics (Greenberg, 1963) were confronted with much contradicting evidence in recent years (Evans and Levinson, 2009), and the long quest for translation universals (Mauranen and Kujama\u0308ki, 2004) should now be viewed in light of our finding: more than anything else, translations are typified by interference.", 
        "179": "This does not undermine the force of translation universals: we demonstrated how explicitation, in the form of cohesive markers, can help identify translations.", 
        "180": "It may be possible to define classi-\nfiers implementing other universal facets of translation, e.g., simplification, which will yield good separation between O and T. However, explicitation fails in the reproduction of language typology, whereas interference-based features produce trees of considerable quality.", 
        "181": "Remarkably, translations to contemporary English and French capture part of the millenniumold history of the source languages from which the translations were made.", 
        "182": "Our trees reflect some of the historical connections among the languages, but of course they are related in other ways, too (whether incidental, areal, etc.).", 
        "183": "This may explain the case of Romanian in our reconstructed trees: it has been isolated for many years from other Romance languages and was under heavy influence from Balto-Slavic languages.", 
        "184": "Very little research has been done in historical linguistics on how translations impact the evolvement of languages.", 
        "185": "The major trends relate to loan translations (Jahr, 1999), or the impact of canonical texts, such as Luther\u2019s translation of the Bible to German (Russ, 1994) or the case of the King James translation to English (Crystal, 2010).", 
        "186": "It has been attested that for certain languages, up to 30% of published materials are mediated through translation (Pym and Chrupa\u0142a, 2005).", 
        "187": "Given the fingerprints left on target language texts, translations very likely play a role in language change.", 
        "188": "We leave this as a direction for future research.", 
        "189": "Acknowledgements  We wish to thank the three ACL anonymous reviewers for their constructive feedback.", 
        "190": "We are grateful to Sergiu Nisioi and Oren Weimann for their advice and helpful suggestions.", 
        "191": "We are also thankful to Yonatan Belinkov and Michael Katz for insightful and valuable comments."

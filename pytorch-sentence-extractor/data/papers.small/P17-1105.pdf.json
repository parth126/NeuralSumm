        "146": "Our basic system achieves\na new state-of-the-art accuracy of 91.4% on the JOBS dataset, and this number improves to 92.9% when supervised attention is added.", 
        "147": "On the ATIS and GEO datasets, we respectively exceed and match the results of Dong and Lapata (2016).", 
        "148": "However, these fall short of the previous best results of 91.3% and 90.4%, respectively, obtained by Wang et al.", 
        "149": "(2014).", 
        "150": "This difference may be partially attributable to the use of typing information or rich lexicons in most previous semantic parsing approaches (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007; Kwiatkowski et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014; Zhao and Huang, 2015).", 
        "151": "On the HEARTHSTONE dataset, we improve significantly over the initial results of Ling et al.", 
        "152": "(2016) across all evaluation metrics, as shown in Table 2.", 
        "153": "On the more stringent exact match metric, we improve from 6.1% to 18.2%, and on tokenlevel BLEU, we improve from 67.1 to 77.6.", 
        "154": "When supervised attention is added, we obtain an additional increase of several points on each scale, achieving peak results of 22.7% accuracy and 79.2 BLEU.", 
        "155": "4.5 Error Analysis and Discussion  As the examples in Figures 6-8 show, classes in the HEARTHSTONE dataset share a great deal of common structure.", 
        "156": "As a result, in the simplest cases, such as in Figure 6, generating the code is simply a matter of matching the overall structure and plugging in the correct values in the initializer and a few other places.", 
        "157": "In such cases, our system generally predicts the correct code, with the\nexception of instances in which strings are incorrectly transduced.", 
        "158": "Introducing a dedicated copying mechanism like the one used by Ling et al.", 
        "159": "(2016) or more specialized machinery for string transduction may alleviate this latter problem.", 
        "160": "The next simplest category of card-code pairs consists of those in which the card\u2019s logic is mostly implemented via nested function calls.", 
        "161": "Figure 7 illustrates a typical case, in which the card\u2019s effect is triggered by a game event (a spell being cast) and both the trigger and the effect are described by arguments to an Effect constructor.", 
        "162": "Our system usually also performs well on instances like these, apart from idiosyncratic errors that can take the form of under- or overgeneration or simply substitution of incorrect predicates.", 
        "163": "Cards whose code includes complex logic expressed in an imperative style, as in Figure 8, pose the greatest challenge for our system.", 
        "164": "Factors like variable naming, nontrivial control flow, and interleaving of code predictable from the description with code required due to the conventions of the library combine to make the code for these cards difficult to generate.", 
        "165": "In some instances (as in the figure), our system is nonetheless able to synthesize a close approximation.", 
        "166": "However, in the most complex cases, the predictions deviate significantly from the correct implementation.", 
        "167": "In addition to the specific errors our system makes, some larger issues remain unresolved.", 
        "168": "Existing evaluation metrics only approximate the actual metric of interest: functional equivalence.", 
        "169": "Modifications of BLEU, tree F1, and exact\nmatch that canonicalize the code\u2014for example, by anonymizing all variables\u2014may prove more meaningful.", 
        "170": "Direct evaluation of functional equivalence is of course impossible in general (Sipser, 2006), and practically challenging even for the HEARTHSTONE dataset because it requires integrating with the game engine.", 
        "171": "Existing work also does not attempt to enforce semantic coherence in the output.", 
        "172": "Long-distance semantic dependencies, between occurrences of a single variable for example, in particular are not modeled.", 
        "173": "Nor is well-typedness or executability.", 
        "174": "Overcoming these evaluation and modeling issues remains an important open problem.", 
        "175": "5 Conclusion  ASNs provide a modular encoder-decoder architecture that can readily accommodate a variety of tasks with structured output spaces.", 
        "176": "They are particularly applicable in the presence of recursive decompositions, where they can provide a simple decoding process that closely parallels the inherent structure of the outputs.", 
        "177": "Our results demonstrate their promise for tree prediction tasks, and we believe their application to more general output structures is an interesting avenue for future work.",

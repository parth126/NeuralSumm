        "46": "In order to design linguistic patterns, we focus on hashtags appearing in the corpus that have been popular clues for locating subjective statements such as sentiments (Davidov et al., 2010), emotions (Qadir and Riloff, 2014), and ironies (Van Hee et al., 2016).", 
        "47": "Hashtags are also useful for finding strong supporters and critics, as well as their target topics; for example, #immigrantsWelcome indicates that the author favors immigrants; and #StopAbortion is against abortion.",

        "69": "Therefore, we sorted topics in descending order of their co-occurrence frequencies with each of the pro patterns and con patterns, and then removed meaningless topics in the top 100 topics.", 
        "70": "This resulted in 9,961,509 tuples regarding 273,417 users and 2,323 topics.", 
        "71": "3 Matrix Factorization  Using the methods described in Section 2, from the corpus, we collected a number of instances of users\u2019 preferences regarding various topics.", 
        "72": "However, Twitter users do not necessarily express preferences for all topics.", 
        "73": "In addition, it is by nature impossible to predict whether a new (i.e., nonexistent in the data) user agrees or disagrees with given topics.", 
        "74": "Therefore, in this section, we apply matrix factorization (Koren et al., 2009) in order to predict missing values, inspired by research regarding item recommendation (Bell and Koren, 2007; Dror et al., 2011).",

        "78": "Thus, an element ru,t approaches +1 as the user u favors the topic t, and \u22121 otherwise.", 
        "79": "If the user u does not make any statement regarding the topic t (i.e., neither (u, t,+1) nor (u, t,\u22121) exists in the data), we do not fill the corresponding element, leaving it as a missing value.", 
        "80": "Matrix factorization decomposes the sparse matrix R into low-dimensional matrices P \u2208 Rk\u00d7|U | andQ \u2208 Rk\u00d7|T |, where k is a parameter that specifies the number of dimensions of the latent space.",

        "145": "These studies\nmodel the political spectrum from liberal to conservative (Adamic and Glance, 2005; Zhou et al., 2011; Cohen and Ruths, 2013; Bakshy et al., 2015; Wong et al., 2016), political parties (Tumasjan et al., 2010; Boutet et al., 2013; Makazhanov and Rafiei, 2013), and elections (O\u2019Connor et al., 2010; Conover et al., 2011).", 
        "146": "Employing a single axis (e.g., liberal to conservative) or a few axes (e.g., political parties and candidates of elections), these studies provide intuitive visualizations and interpretations along the respective axes.", 
        "147": "In contrast, this study is the first attempt to recognize and organize various axes of topics on social media with no prior assumptions regarding the axes.", 
        "148": "Therefore, we think our study provides a new tool for computational social science and political science that enables researchers to analyze and interpret phenomena on social media.", 
        "149": "Next, we describe previous research focused on acquiring lexical knowledge of politics.", 
        "150": "Sim et al.", 
        "151": "(2013) measured ideological positions of candidates in US presidential elections from their\nspeeches.", 
        "152": "The study first constructs \u201ccue lexicons\u201d from political writings labeled with ideologies by domain experts, using sparse additive generative models (Eisenstein et al., 2011).", 
        "153": "These constructed cue lexicons were associated with such ideologies as left, center, and right.", 
        "154": "Representing each speech of a candidate with cue lexicons, they inferred the proportions of ideologies of the candidate.", 
        "155": "The study requires a predefined set of labels and text data associated with the labels.", 
        "156": "Bamman and Smith (2015) presented an unsupervised method for assessing the political stance of a proposition, such as \u201cglobal warming is a hoax,\u201d along the political spectrum of liberal to conservative.", 
        "157": "In their work, a proposition was represented by a tuple in the form \u3008subject, predicate\u3009, for example, \u3008global warming, hoax\u3009.", 
        "158": "They presented a generative model for users, subjects, and predicates to find a one-dimensional latent space that corresponded to the political spectrum.", 
        "159": "Similar to our present work, their work (Bamman and Smith, 2015) did not require labeled data\nto map users and topics (i.e., subjects) onto a latent feature space.", 
        "160": "In their paper, they reported that the generative model outperformed Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which is a method for matrix factorization.", 
        "161": "Empirical results here probably reflected the underlying assumptions that PCA treats missing elements as zero and not as missing data.", 
        "162": "In contrast, in the present work, we properly distinguish missing values from zero, excluding missing elements of the original matrix from the objective function of Equation 2.", 
        "163": "Further, this work demonstrated the usefulness of the latent space, that is, topic and user vectors, in predicting missing topic preferences of users and inter-topic preferences.", 
        "164": "Fine-grained Opinion Analysis The method presented in Section 2 is an instance of finegrained opinion analysis (Wiebe et al., 2005; Choi et al., 2006; Johansson and Moschitti, 2010; Yang and Cardie, 2013; Deng and Wiebe, 2015), which extracts a tuple of a subjective opinion, a holder of the opinion, and a target of the opinion from text.", 
        "165": "Although these previous studies have the potential to improve the quality of the user-topic matrix R, unfortunately, no corpus or resource is available for the Japanese language.", 
        "166": "We do not currently have a large collection of English tweets, but combining fine-grained opinion analysis with matrix factorization is an immediate future work.", 
        "167": "Causality Relation Some of inter-topic preferences in this work can be explained by causality relation, for example, \u201cTPP promotes free trade.\u201d A number of previous studies acquire instances of causal relation (Girju, 2003; Do et al., 2011) and promote/suppress relation (Hashimoto et al., 2012; Fluck et al., 2015) from text.", 
        "168": "The causality knowledge is useful for predicting (hypotheses of) future events (Radinsky et al., 2012; Radinsky and Davidovich, 2012; Hashimoto et al., 2015).", 
        "169": "Inter-topic preferences, however, also include pairs of topics in which causality relation hardly holds.", 
        "170": "As an example, it is unreasonable to infer that nuclear plant and railroading of bills have a causal relation, but those who dislike nuclear plant also oppose railroading of bills because presumably they think the governing political parties rush the bill for resuming a nuclear plant.", 
        "171": "In this study, we model these inter-topic preferences based on preferences of the public.", 
        "172": "That said, we have as a promising future direction of our work plans to in-\ncorporate approaches to acquire causality knowledge.", 
        "173": "6 Conclusion  In this paper, we presented a novel approach for modeling inter-topic preferences of users on Twitter.", 
        "174": "Designing linguistic patterns for identifying support and opposition statements, we extracted users\u2019 preferences regarding various topics from a large collection of tweets.", 
        "175": "We formalized the task of modeling inter-topic preferences as a matrix factorization that maps both users and topics onto a latent feature space that abstracts users\u2019 preferences.", 
        "176": "Through our experimental results, we demonstrated that our approach was able to accurately predict missing topic preferences of users (80\u201394%) and that our latent vector representations of topics properly encoded inter-topic preferences.", 
        "177": "For our immediate future work, we plan to embed the topic and user vectors to create a crosstopic stance detector.", 
        "178": "It is possible to generalize our work to model heterogeneous signals, such as interests and behaviors of people, for example, \u201cthose who are interested in A also support B,\u201d and \u201cthose who favor A also vote for B\u201d.", 
        "179": "Therefore, we believe that our work will bring about new applications in the field of NLP and other disciplines.",

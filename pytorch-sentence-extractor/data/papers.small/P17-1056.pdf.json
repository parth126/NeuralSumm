        "73": "WHAM is a hierarchical generative modeling framework, so it uses information from related observations (e.g., multiple repliers with similar demographics) to improve its robustness on sparse data (Doyle et al., 2016).", 
        "74": "There are two key parameters, shown in Figure 2: \u03b7base, the log-odds of a given word category c when the preceding message did not contain c, and \u03b7align, the increase in the log-odds of c when the preceding message did contain c.\nA dynamic extension To understand enculturation, we need to track changes in both the alignment and baseline over time.", 
        "75": "We add a month-bymonth change term to WHAM, yielding a piecewise linear model of these factors over the course of an employee\u2019s tenure.", 
        "76": "Each employee\u2019s tenure is broken into two or three segments: their first six months after being hired, their last six months before leaving (if they leave), and the rest of their tenure.2 The linear segments for their alignment are fit as an intercept term \u03b7align, based at their first month (for the initial period) or their last month (for the final period), and per-month slopes \u03b1.

        "82": "For each word category c, WHAM\u2019s generative model represents each reply as a series of tokenby-token independent draws from a binomial distribution.", 
        "83": "The binomial probability \u00b5 is dependent on whether the preceding message did (\u00b5align) or did not (\u00b5base) contain a word from category c, and the inferred alignment value is the difference between these probabilities in log-odds space (\u03b7align).",

        "85": "4As shown in Figure 1, the pieces do not need to define a continuous function.", 
        "86": "Alignment behaviors continue to change in the middle of an employee\u2019s tenure (Srivastava et al., forthcoming), so alignment six months in to the job is unlikely to be equal to alignment six months from leaving, or the average alignment over the middle tenure.",

        "88": "Note that the hierarchical ordering is different for the \u03b7 chains and the \u03b1/\u03b2 chains; c is above g and t for the \u03b7 chains, but below them for the \u03b1/\u03b2 chains.", 
        "89": "This is because we expect the static (\u03b7) values for a given word category to be relatively consistent across different groups and at different times, but we expect the values to be independent across the different word categories.", 
        "90": "Conversely, we expect that the enculturation trajectories across word categories (\u03b1/\u03b2) will be similar, while the trajectories may vary substantially across different groups and different times.", 
        "91": "Lastly, the month m in which a reply is written (measured from the start of the time period t) has a linear effect on the \u03b7 value, as described below.", 
        "92": "To estimate alignment, we first divide the replies up by group, time period, and calendar month.", 
        "93": "We separate the replies into two sets based on whether the preceding message contained the category c (the \u201calignment\u201d set) or not (the \u201cbaseline\u201d set).",

        "96": "The \u00b5 values are then in turn generated from \u03b7 values in log-odds space by an inverse-logit transform, similar to linear predictors in logistic regression.", 
        "97": "The \u03b7base variables are representations of the baseline frequency of a marker in log-odds space, and \u00b5base is simply a conversion of \u03b7base to probability space, the equivalent of an intercept term in a logistic regression.",

        "107": "All of our analyses are based on parameter estimates from RStan fits of WHAM with 500 iterations over four chains.", 
        "108": "While previous research on cultural fit has emphasized either its internalization (O\u2019Reilly et al., 1991) or self-regulation (Goldberg et al., 2016) components, our extension to the WHAM framework helps disentangle them by estimating them as separate baseline and alignment trajectories.", 
        "109": "For example, we can distinguish between an archetypal individual who initially aligns to her colleagues and then internalizes this style of communication such that her baseline use also shifts and another archetypal person who aligns to her colleagues but does not change her baseline usage.",

        "145": "We fit separate classifiers for leaving voluntarily or involuntarily.", 
        "146": "Our results show that early alignment behaviors are better at identifying employees who will leave involuntarily than voluntarily, consistent with Srivastava et al.\u2019s (forthcoming) findings that voluntary leavers are similar to stayers until late in their tenure.", 
        "147": "We fit separate classifiers using the alignment parameters and the baseline parameters to investigate their relative informativity.", 
        "148": "For each model, we report the area under the curve (AUC).", 
        "149": "This value is estimated from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate over different classification thresholds.", 
        "150": "An AUC of 0.5 represents chance performance.", 
        "151": "We use balanced, stratified cross-\nvalidation to reduce AUC misestimation due to unbalanced outcome frequencies and high noise (Parker et al., 2007).", 
        "152": "Results The left column of Figure 5 shows the results over 10 runs of 10-fold balanced logistic classifiers with stratified cross-validation in R. The alignment-based classifiers are both above chance at predicting that an employee will leave the company, whether involuntarily or voluntarily.", 
        "153": "The baseline-based classifiers perform worse, especially on voluntary leavers.", 
        "154": "This finding is consistent with the idea that voluntary leavers resemble stayers (who form the bulk of the employees) until late in their tenure when their cultural fit declines.", 
        "155": "We fit a model using both alignment and baseline parameters, but this model yielded an AUC value below the alignment-only classifier.", 
        "156": "This suggests that where alignment and baseline behaviors are both predictive, they do not provide substantially different predictive power and lead to overfitting.", 
        "157": "A more sophisticated classifier may overcome these challenges; our goal here was not to achieve maximal classification performance but to test whether alignment provided any useful information about employment outcomes.", 
        "158": "5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment  Our final analysis investigates the nature of linguistic alignment: specifically, whether there is an effect of referential alignment beyond that of the more commonly used lexical alignment.", 
        "159": "Testing this hypothesis requires a small change to the alignment calculations.", 
        "160": "Lexical alignment is based on the conditional probability of the replier using a word category c given that the preceding message used that same category c. For referential alignment, we examine the conditional probability of the replier using a word category cj given that the preceding message used the category ci, where ci and cj are likely to be referentially linked.", 
        "161": "We also consider cases where ci is likely to transition to cj throughout the course of the conversation, such as present tense verbs turning into past tense as the event being described recedes into the past.", 
        "162": "The pairs of categories that are likely to be referentially or transitionally linked are: (you, I); (we, I); (you, we); (past, present); (present, future); and (certainty, tentativity).", 
        "163": "We include both directions of these pairs, so this provides approximately the same number of predictor variables for both situa-\ntions to maximize comparability (12 for the referential alignments, 11 for the lexical).", 
        "164": "This modification does not change the structure of the WHAM model, but rather changes its C and N counts by reclassifying replies between the baseline or alignment pathways.", 
        "165": "Results Figure 5 plots the differences in predictive model performance using lexical versus referential alignment parameters.", 
        "166": "We find that the semantic parameters provide more accurate classification than the lexical both for voluntarily and involuntarily-leaving employees.", 
        "167": "This suggests that while previous work looking at lexical alignment successfully captures social structure, referential alignment may reflect a deeper and more accurate representation of the social structure.", 
        "168": "It is unclear if this behavior holds in less formal situations or with weaker organizational structure and shared goals, but these results suggest that the traditional alignment approach of only measuring lexical alignment should be augmented with referential alignment measures for a more complete analysis.", 
        "169": "6 Discussion  A key finding from this work is that pronoun usage behaviors in employees\u2019 email communication are consistent with social integration into the group; employees use \u201cI\u201d pronouns less and\n\u201cwe\u201d pronouns more as they integrate.", 
        "170": "Furthermore, we see the importance of using an alignment measure such as WHAM for distinguishing the base rate and alignment usage of words.", 
        "171": "Employees who leave the company involuntarily show increased \u201cwe\u201d usage through greater alignment, using \u201cwe\u201d more when prompted by a colleague, but introducing it less of their own accord.", 
        "172": "This suggests that these employees do not feel fully integrated into the group, although they are willing to identify as a part of it when a more fully-integrated group member includes them, corresponding to self-regularization over internalization.", 
        "173": "The fact that these alignment measures alone, without any job productivity or performance metrics, have some predictive capability for employees\u2019 leaving the company suggests the potential for support or intervention programs to help highperforming but poorly-integrated employees integrate into the company better.", 
        "174": "More generally, the prominence of pronominally-driven communication changes suggest that alignment analyses can provide insight into a range of social integration settings.", 
        "175": "This may be especially helpful in cases where there is great pressure to integrate smoothly, and people would be likely to adopt a self-regulating approach even if they do not internalize their group membership.", 
        "176": "Such settings not only include the high-stakes situation of keeping one\u2019s job, but of transitioning from high school to college or moving to a new country or region.", 
        "177": "Maximizing the chances for new members to become comfortable within a group is critical both for spreading useful aspects of the group\u2019s existing culture to new members and for integrating new ideas from the new members\u2019 knowledge and practices.", 
        "178": "Alignment-based approaches can be a useful tool in separating effective interventions that cause internalization of the group dynamics from those that lead to more superficial self-regularization changes.", 
        "179": "7 Conclusions  This paper described an effort to use directed linguistic alignment as a measure of cultural fit within an organization.", 
        "180": "We adapted a hierarchical alignment model from previous work to estimate fit within corporate email communications, focusing on changes in language during employees\u2019 entry to and exit from the company.", 
        "181": "Our results\nshowed substantial changes in the use of pronouns, with pronoun patterns varying by employees\u2019 outcomes within the company.The use of the firstperson plural \u201cwe\u201d during an employee\u2019s first six months is particularly instructive.", 
        "182": "Whereas stayers exhibited increased baseline use, indicating internalization, those eventually departing involuntarily were on the one hand decreasingly likely to introduce \u201cwe\u201d into conversation, but increasingly responsive to interlocutors\u2019 use of the pronoun.", 
        "183": "While not internalizing a shared identity with their peers, involuntarily departed employees were overly self-regulating in response to its invocation by others.", 
        "184": "Quantitatively, rates of usage and alignment in the first six months of employment carried information about whether employees left involuntarily, pointing towards fit within the company culture early on as an indicator of eventual employment outcomes.", 
        "185": "Finally, we saw ways in which the application of alignment to cultural fit might help to refine ideas about alignment itself: preliminary analysis suggested that referential, rather than lexical, alignment was more predictive of employment outcomes.", 
        "186": "More broadly, these results suggest ways that quantitative methods can be used to make precise application of concepts like \u201ccultural fit\u201d at scale.",

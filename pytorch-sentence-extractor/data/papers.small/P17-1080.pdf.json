        "127": "POS and morphology accuracies share an intriguing pattern: the representations that are learned when translating into English are better for predicting POS or morphology than those learned when translating into German, which are in turn better than those learned when translating into Hebrew.", 
        "128": "This is remarkable given that English is a morphologically-poor language that does not display many of the morphological properties that are found in the Arabic source.", 
        "129": "In contrast, German and Hebrew have richer morphologies, so one could expect that translating into them would make the model learn more about morphology.", 
        "130": "A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the Arabic-English model is simply better than the Arabic-Hebrew and Arabic-German models, as hinted by the BLEU scores in Table 2.", 
        "131": "The inherent difficulty in translating Arabic to Hebrew/German may affect the ability to learn good representations of word structure.",

        "152": "Presumably, it is sufficient for the decoder to learn a strong language model in order to produce morphologically-correct output, without learning much about morphology, while the encoder needs to learn quite a lot about source language morphology in order to create a good generic representation.",

        "154": "5.1 Effect of attention  Consider the role of the attention mechanism in learning useful representations: during decoding, the attention weights are combined with the decoder\u2019s hidden states to generate the current translation.", 
        "155": "These two sources of information need to jointly point to the most relevant source word(s) and predict the next most likely word.",

        "162": "By character representation we mean a character CNN on the input words.",

        "167": "A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the decoder\u2019s predictions are still done at word level even with the char-based model (which encodes the target input but not the output).",

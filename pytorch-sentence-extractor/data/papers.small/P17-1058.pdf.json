        "10": "Grounding theory (Clark and Brennan, 1991) models a successful communication as a process during which \u201ccommon ground\u201d (i.e., mutual knowledge, beliefs etc.)", 
        "11": "is jointly built among interlocutors.", 
        "12": "The interactive alignment model (IAM) (Pickering and Garrod, 2004) proposes that the ultimate goal of dialogue is the alignment of interlocutors\u2019 situational model, which is helped by alignment at all other lower representation levels (e.g., lexical, syntactic etc.", 
        "13": "), driven by the psychologically well-documented priming effects.", 
        "14": "Recently, empirical studies have verified the explanatory powers of the above-mentioned theories, especially the IAM, utilizing dialogues recorded and transcribed from various collaborative tasks conducted in laboratory settings (Reitter and Moore, 2007; Reitter and Moore, 2014; Fusaroli et al., 2012; Fusaroli and Tyle\u0301n, 2016).", 
        "15": "In those studies, the quality of communication is directly reflected in the collaborative performance of interlocutors, i.e., how successful they are in accomplishing the task.", 
        "16": "Although they do not come to fully agree on which theoretical accounts of dialogue (e.g., interactive alignment vs. interpersonal synergy) provides better explanations (see Section 2.1 for details), the majority of these studies have confirmed that the alignment of certain linguistic markers, lexical items, or syntactic rules between interlocutors correlates with task success.", 
        "17": "What is missing from the picture, however, is the computational understanding of how strategies of interaction and the mix of information contributions to the conversation facilitate successful communication.", 
        "18": "This is understandable because those higher level concepts do not directly map onto the atomic linguistic elements and thus are much more difficult to define and operationalize.", 
        "19": "In the present study, we intend to explore this missing part of work by characterizing how the interaction between interlocutors in terms of their information contributions affects the quality of communication.", 
        "20": "1.1 An information-based approach  Recent work has already used information theory to study the dynamics of dialogue.", 
        "21": "Xu and Reitter (2016b) observed that the amount of lexical information (measured by entropy) from interlocutors of different roles, converges within the span of topic episodes in natural spoken dialogue.", 
        "22": "Anon (2017) interpret this converging pattern as a re-\n623\nflection of the dynamic process in which the information contributed by two interlocutors fluctuates in a complementary way at the early stage, and gradually reaches an equilibrium status.", 
        "23": "Xu and Reitter (2016b) also correlated this entropy converging pattern with the topic shift phenomenon that frequently occurs in natural conversation (Ng and Bradac, 1993), and proposed that it reflects the process of interlocutors building the common ground that is necessary for the ongoing topics of conversation.", 
        "24": "Based on Xu and Reitter\u2019s (2016) finding that entropy converging pattern repeatedly occurs within dialogue (though not necessarily at strictly regular intervals), it is reasonable to expect that after applying some spectral analysis techniques (time space to frequency space conversion) to the entropy series of dialogue, the frequency space representations should demonstrate some patterns that are distinct from white noise, because the periodicity properties in time space are captured.", 
        "25": "Furthermore, we expect that how the frequency representations of two interlocutors correlate provides some information about the higher level properties of dialogue, e.g., the task performance etc.", 
        "26": "The thought is intuitive: If we imagine the entropy series from two interlocutors as two ideal sinusoidal signals s1 and s2 (supposedly of different frequencies, f1 and f2) (Figure 1), then the observed converging pattern can be thought of as a segment from the full spans of the signals.", 
        "27": "Then the frequency space properties, such as how close f1 and f2 are, and the phase difference \u03c6 between them, will definitely affect the shape of the converging pattern (solid lines in Figure 1).", 
        "28": "As Xu and Reitter (2016b) argues that the converging segment reflects the grounding process between interlocutors, it is reasonable to expect that the shape and length of this segment are reflective of how well interlocutors understand each other, and the overall collaborative performance as well.", 
        "29": "Based on the above considerations, the goal of the present study is to explore how the frequency space representations of the entropy series of dialogue are correlated with the collaborative performance of task.", 
        "30": "We first demonstrate that entropy series satisfy the prerequisites of spectral analysis techniques in Section 4.", 
        "31": "Then we use two frequency space statistics, power spectrum overlap (PSO) and relative phase (RP), to predict task success.", 
        "32": "The reasons of using these two specific in-\ndices are discussed in Section 2.3, and their definitions are given in Section 3.3.", 
        "33": "The results are shown in Sections 5 to 7, and the implications are discussed.", 
        "34": "2 Related Work    2.1 The success of dialogue  The interactive-alignment model (IAM) (Pickering and Garrod, 2004) stipulates that communication is successful to the extent that communicators \u201cunderstand relevant aspects of the world in the same way as each other\u201d (Garrod and Pickering, 2009).", 
        "35": "Qualitative and quantitative studies (Garrod and A. Anderson, 1987; Pickering and Garrod, 2006; Reitter and Moore, 2014) have revealed that the alignment of linguistic elements at different representation levels between interlocutors facilitates the success of task-oriented dialogues.", 
        "36": "More recently, different theoretical accounts other than IAM, such as interpersonal synergy (Fusaroli et al., 2014) and complexity matching (Abney et al., 2014) have been proposed to explain the mechanism of successful dialogue from the perspective of dynamic systems.", 
        "37": "Fusaroli and Tyle\u0301n (2016) compare the approaches of interactive alignment and interpersonal synergy in terms of how well they predict the collective performance in a joint task.",

        "41": "They demonstrate the acoustic onset events in speech signals exhibit power law clustering across timescales, and the\ncomplexity matching in these power law functions is reflective of whether the conversation is affiliative or argumentative.", 
        "42": "The perspective taken by the present study has some common places with Fusaroli and Tyle\u0301n (2016) and Abney et al.\u2019s (2014) work: we view dialogue as an interaction of two dynamic systems.", 
        "43": "The joint decision-making task used by Fusaroli and Tyle\u0301n (2016) resulted in a small corpus of dialogue in Danish, which we will use for the present study.", 
        "44": "2.2 Information density in natural language  Information Theory (Shannon, 1948) predicts that the optimal way to communicate is to send information at a constant rate, a.k.a.", 
        "45": "the principle of entropy rate constancy (ERC).", 
        "46": "The way humans use natural language to communicate also follows this principle: by computing the local per-word entropy of the sentence (which, under the prediction of ERC, will increase with sentence position), ERC is confirmed in both written text (Genzel and Charniak, 2002; Genzel and Charniak, 2003; Keller, 2004; Qian and Jaeger, 2011) and spoken dialogue (Xu and Reitter, 2016b; Xu and Reitter, 2016a).",

        "48": "The information density in language, i.e., the distribution of entropy (predictability), reveal the discourse structure to some extent.", 
        "49": "For example, entropy drops at the boundaries between topics (Genzel and Charniak, 2003; Qian and Jaeger, 2011), and increases within a topic episode in dialogue (Xu and Reitter, 2016b) (see Section 1.1).", 
        "50": "The entropy of microblog text reflects changes in contextual information (e.g., an unexpected event in a sports game) (Doyle and Frank, 2015).", 
        "51": "In sum, per-word entropy quantifies the amount of lexical information in natural language, and therefore fulfills the needs of modeling the information contribution from interlocutors.", 
        "52": "2.3 Spectral analysis methodology  Spectral analysis, also referred to as frequency domain analysis, is a pervasively used technique in physics, engineering, economics and social sciences.", 
        "53": "The key idea of it is to decompose a complex signal in time space into simpler components in frequency space, using mathematical operations such as Fourier transform (Bracewell, 1986).", 
        "54": "The application of spectral analysis in human language technology mainly focuses on processing the acoustic signals of human voice, and capturing the para-linguistics features relevant to certain tasks (Schuller et al., 2013).",

        "56": "(2010) find that utterance-level spectral features are useful for emotion recognition.", 
        "57": "Gregory Jr and Gallagher (2002) demonstrate that spectral information beneath 0.5 kHz can predict US president election outcomes.", 
        "58": "However, we are not aware of the usage of spectral analysis in studying linguistic phenomena at higher representation levels than the acoustic level.", 
        "59": "For our study, we are looking for some techniques that can capture the coupling between two signals at frequency space.", 
        "60": "The nature of the signal (whether it is language-related or not) should not be the first concern from the perspective of methodology.", 
        "61": "Therefore, studies outside the field of speech communication and linguistics could also be enlightening to our work.",

        "130": "4.1 Examine stationarity  We use three pervasively used statistical tests to test the stationarity of our entropy series data: the\naugmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test (Dickey and Fuller, 1979), the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-SchmidtShin (KPSS) test (Kwiatkowski et al., 1992), and the Phillips-Perron (PP) test (Phillips and Perron, 1988).",

        "132": "We can see that the majority of our data satisfy the assumption of stationarity, and thus it is valid to conduct Fourier transform on the entropy series.", 
        "133": "The stationarity property seems contradictory to the previous findings about entropy increase in written text and spoken dialogue (Genzel and Charniak, 2002; Genzel and Charniak, 2003; Xu and Reitter, 2016b), because stationarity predicts that the mean entropy stays constant over time.", 
        "134": "We examine this in our data by fitting a simple linear model with entropy as the dependent, and sentence position as the independent variable, which yields significant (marginal) effects of the latter: For Map Task, \u03b2 = 2.3\u00d7 10\u22123, p < .05, Adj-R2 = 1.7\u00d7 10\u22124; For DJD, \u03b2 = 7.2\u00d7 10\u22125, p = .06, Adj-R2 = 2.2\u00d7 10\u22124.", 
        "135": "It indicates that the stationarity of entropy series does not conflict with the entropy increasing trend predicted by the principle of ERC (Shannon, 1948).",

        "148": "We try several lags on each entropy series, and pick the smallest p-value.",

        "158": "To rectify this issue, we adopt a Box-Cox transformation (Box and Cox, 1964) on the dependent variable, PATHDEV, which is a typical way of handling heteroscedasticity.", 
        "159": "The new model that uses PSO to predict the Box-Cox transformed PATHDEV also yields significant coefficients: \u03b2 = 3.85, SE = 1.67, F (1, 113) = 5.32, p < .05.",

        "171": "This assumption is reasonable because previous work has shown that sudden change in entropy predicts topic change in dialogue (Genzel and Charniak, 2003; Qian and Jaeger, 2011; Xu and Reitter, 2016b).", 
        "172": "We argue that higher synchrony (larger overlap in frequency space) in terms of how much novelty each interlocutor contributes, does not necessarily leads to better outcomes of communication.", 
        "173": "Rather, we would expect the correlation to be opposite (and our empirical results confirm this), because dialogue is a joint activity, in which a taking on different roles as interlocutors (e.g., the one who gives orders versus the one who follows) is often required to push the activity along (Clark, 1996).", 
        "174": "A dialogue with maximal synchrony or frequency overlap would be one where partners take turns at regular intervals.", 
        "175": "Perhaps because such regularity in turn-taking assigns no special roles to interlocutors, and because they engage in turntaking with no regard for content, it is not strange that such synchrony is disadvantageous.", 
        "176": "Let\u2019s look at several scenarios of different synchrony levels between interlocutors: First, high synchrony due to both interlocutors contributing large amount of new information, which means there is more overlap near the high frequency band of spectrums.", 
        "177": "In this case, they are more likely to have difficulty in comprehending each other due\nto the potential information overload.", 
        "178": "Situations such as arguing, or both speakers asking a lot of questions are good examples.", 
        "179": "Second, high synchrony due to both interlocutors providing ineffective information, which indicates overlap in spectrums near the low frequency band.", 
        "180": "Obviously this type of ineffective communication is not helpful to the collaborative task.", 
        "181": "Third, low synchrony due to one interlocutor providing more information and the other one providing less, which means the overlap in spectrums is minimum.", 
        "182": "An example of this case is that one interlocutor is saying something important, while the other one is producing short utterances such \u201cuh-huh\u201d, \u201cyes\u201d, or short questions to make sure that they are on the same page, which is known as the back-channel mechanism in conversation (Orestro\u0308m, 1983).", 
        "183": "This complementary style of communication allows them to build mutual understand of each other\u2019s intention, and thus reaches better collaborative performance.", 
        "184": "6 RP Predicts Task Success    6.1 Results of linear models  We obtain the relative phase (RP) vector (absolute values) of all frequency components, and fit linear models using the mean of RP as predictor, and task performance as the dependent variable.", 
        "185": "We get non-significant coefficients for both models: For Map Task, F (1, 113) = .004, p > .05; for DJD, F (1, 14) = .772, p > .05.", 
        "186": "This suggests that the phase information of all frequency components in spectrum is not very indicative of task success.", 
        "187": "The power spectra describe the distribution of energy across the span of frequency components that compose the signal.", 
        "188": "The frequency components with higher energy (peaks in spectrum) are more dominant than those with lower energy (troughs) in determining the nature of the signal.", 
        "189": "Therefore it makes sense to only include the peak frequencies into the model, because they are more \u201crepresentative\u201d of the signal, and so the \u201cnoise\u201d from the low energy frequencies are filtered out.", 
        "190": "Thus we obtain RP from the local peak frequency components, and use the mean, median, and maximum values of them as predictors.", 
        "191": "It turns out that for Map Task, the maximum of RP is a significant predictor (the mean and median are left out via stepwise analysis).", 
        "192": "For DJD, the mean of RP is a significant predictor of task success (when median and maximum are included in the model).", 
        "193": "(see Table 3).", 
        "194": "From the significant effect of maximum RP in Map Task and mean RP in DJD, it is safe to state that RP is positively correlated with task performance.", 
        "195": "However, this relationship is not as straight-forward as PSO, because of the marginal effect at the opposite direction.", 
        "196": "A more finegrained analysis is required, but it is outside the scope of this study.", 
        "197": "6.2 Discussion  The relative phase in frequency space can be understood as the \u201clag\u201d between signals in time space.", 
        "198": "Imagine that we align the two entropy series from one dialogue onto the same time scale (just like Figure 1), the distance between the entropy \u201cpeaks\u201d is proportionate to the relative phase in frequency space.", 
        "199": "Then, the positive correlation between relative phase and task performance suggests that relatively large delays between entropy\n\u201csurges\u201d seen in each interlocutor are beneficial to collaborative performance.", 
        "200": "The delay of entropy surges can be understood as a strategy for an interlocutor to distribute information in his or her own utterance accordingly with the information received.", 
        "201": "For example, after interlocutor A contributes a big piece of information, the other one, B, does not rush to make new substantial contributions, but instead keeps her utterances at low entropy until it is the proper time to take a turn to contribute.", 
        "202": "This does not have to coincide with dialogic turn-taking.", 
        "203": "This delay gives B more time to \u201cdigest\u201d the information provided by A, which could be an instruction that needs to be comprehended, or a question that needs to be thought about and so on.", 
        "204": "A relatively long delay guarantees enough time for interlocutors to reach mutual understanding.", 
        "205": "On the contrary, if B rushes to speak a lot shortly after the A\u2019s input, then it will probably cause information overload and be harmful to communication.", 
        "206": "Therefore, we believe that the RP statistic captures the extent to which interlocutors manage the proper \u201ctiming\u201d of information contribution to maintain effective communication.", 
        "207": "7 Prediction Task  Here we explore whether the frequency domain features, PSO and RP, can help with an existing framework that utilizes alignment features, such as the repetition of lexical and syntactic elements, to predict the success of dialogue in MapTask (Reitter and Moore, 2007).", 
        "208": "R&M described an SVM model that takes into the repetition count of lexicons (LEXREP) and syntax structures (SYNREP), and the length of dialogues (LENGTH) as features.", 
        "209": "The full model achieves an R2 score of .17, which means that it can account for 17% of the variance of task success.", 
        "210": "We add the new PSO and RP (mean, median and maximum RP features per dialogue are included) covariates to the original SVM model.", 
        "211": "An RBF kernel (\u03b3 = 5) was used.", 
        "212": "The cost parameter C was (coarsely) tuned on different cross-validation folds to reduce overfitting on this relatively small dataset, and the R&M\u2019s original full model was recalculated (shown in Table 4 as R&M).", 
        "213": "Two models with PSO and RP interactions (once without the alignment/repetition features) are shown for comparison.", 
        "214": "(See Table 4).", 
        "215": "Significant improvement in the model\u2019s explanatory power, i.e., R2, is gained after the PSO and RP features are added.", 
        "216": "The best model we have is by adding PSO and RP as predictors without the interaction term (bold number in Table 4), which gives about 60% increase of R2 compared to R&M\u2019s full model.", 
        "217": "Note that even if we exclude the alignment features, and include only (LENGTH) and the frequency features (last row in Table 4), the performance also exceeds R&M\u2019s full model.", 
        "218": "The results indicate that the frequency domain features (PSO and RP) of the sentence information density can capture some hidden factors of task success that are unexplained by the alignment approach.", 
        "219": "It is not surprising that how people coordinate their information contribution matters a lot to the success of the collaboration.", 
        "220": "What we show here is that regular, repeated patterns of information-dense and information-sparse turns seem to make speakers more or less compatible with each other.", 
        "221": "Whether individuals have typical patterns (frequency distributions) of information density, or whether this is a result of dynamic interaction in each particular dialogue, remains to be seen.", 
        "222": "8 Conclusions  The empirical results of the present study suggest that examining how the information contribution from interlocutors co-develops can provide a way to understand dialogue from a higher-level perspective, which has been missing in existing work.", 
        "223": "Our work adds a brick to the series of endeavors on studying the linguistic and behavioral factors of successful dialogue, and for the first time (as far as we know) demonstrates quantitatively that the dynamics of not just \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow\u201d we say, but also \u201chow much\u201d we say and the \u201ctiming\u201d of distributing what we say in dialogue, are relevant to the quality of communication.", 
        "224": "Although the way we model information in language is simply the entropy at lexical level, we believe the findings still reveal the nature of information production and processing in dialogue.", 
        "225": "We hope that by comparing and combining our methodology with other approaches of studying dialogue, we can reach a more comprehensive and holistic understanding of this common yet mysterious human practice.",

        "202": "The two methods don\u2019t consider the semantic representations of adjacent sentences.", 
        "203": "The GG and GG-SEG explore the semantic information of sentences in a sequence by the bidirectional GRU layer.", 
        "204": "The results demonstrate that considering such information improve the performance on all discourse modes.", 
        "205": "This proves the advantage of sequential identification compared with isolated sentence classification.", 
        "206": "We can see that the GG-SEG further improves the performance on three minority discourse modes compared with GG.", 
        "207": "This means that the minority modes may have stronger preference to special locations.", 
        "208": "Exposition benefits most, since many exposition sentences in our dataset are isolated.", 
        "209": "The performance on argument is not so good.", 
        "210": "As we discussed in corpus analysis, argument and emotion expressing mode interact frequently.", 
        "211": "Because the amount of emotion expressing sentences is much more, distinguishing argument from them is hard.", 
        "212": "Actually, their functions in narrative essays seem to be similar that both are to deepen the author\u2019s response or evoke the reader\u2019s response to the story.", 
        "213": "The overall average F1-score can reach to 0.7 and the performance on identifying three most common discourse modes are consistent, with an average F1-score above 0.76 using the proposed neural sequence labeling models.", 
        "214": "Automatic discourse mode identification should be feasible.", 
        "215": "5 Essay Scoring with Discourse Modes  Discourse mode identification can potentially provide features for downstream NLP applications.", 
        "216": "This section describes our attempt to explore discourse modes for automatic essay scoring (AES).", 
        "217": "5.1 Essay Scoring Framework  We adopt the standard regression framework for essay scoring.", 
        "218": "We use support vector regression (SVR) and Bayesian linear ridge regression (BLRR), which are used in recent work (Phandi et al., 2015).", 
        "219": "The key is to design effective features.", 
        "220": "5.2 Features  The basic feature sets are based on (Phandi et al., 2015).The original feature sets include:\n\u2022 Length features\n\u2022 Part-Of-Speech (POS) features\n\u2022 Prompt features\n\u2022 Bag of words features\nWe re-implement the feature extractors exactly according to the description in (Phandi et al., 2015) except for the POS features, since we don\u2019t\nhave correct POS ngrams for Chinese.", 
        "221": "We complement two additional features: (1) The number of words occur in Chinese Proficiency Test 6 vocabulary; (2) The number of Chinese idioms used.", 
        "222": "We further design discourse mode related features for each essay:\n\u2022 Mode ratio: For each discourse mode, we compute its mode ratio according to ratio = #sentences with the discourse mode#sentences in the essay .", 
        "223": "Such features indicate the distribution of discourse modes.", 
        "224": "\u2022 Bag of ngrams of discourse modes: We use the number of unigrams and bigrams of the dominant discourse modes of the sequence of sentences in the essay as features.", 
        "225": "5.3 Experimental Settings  The experiments were conducted on narrative essays written by Chinese middle school students in native language during regional tests.", 
        "226": "There are three prompts and students are required to write an essay related to the given prompt with no less than 600 Chinese characters.", 
        "227": "All these essays were evaluated by professional teachers.", 
        "228": "We randomly sampled essays from each prompt for experiments.", 
        "229": "Table 5 shows the details of the datasets.", 
        "230": "We ran experiments on each prompt dataset respectively by 5-fold cross-validation.", 
        "231": "The GG-SEG model was used to identify discourse modes of sentences.", 
        "232": "Notice that a sentence can have multiple discourse modes.", 
        "233": "The mode ratio features are computed for each mode separately.", 
        "234": "When extracting the bag of ngrams of discourse modes features, the discourse mode with highest prediction probability was chosen as the dominant discourse mode.", 
        "235": "We use the Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) as the evaluation metric.", 
        "236": "5.4 Evaluation Results  Table 6 shows the evaluation results of AES on three datasets.", 
        "237": "We can see that the BLRR algorithm performs better than the SVR algorithm.", 
        "238": "No\nmatter which algorithm is adopted, adding discourse mode features make positive contributions for AES compared with using basic feature sets.", 
        "239": "The trends are consistent over all three datasets.", 
        "240": "Impact of discourse mode ratio on scores: We are interested in which discourse mode correlates to essay scores best.", 
        "241": "Table 7 shows the Pearson correlation coefficient between the mode ratio and essay score.", 
        "242": "LEN represents the correlation of essay length and is listed as a reference.", 
        "243": "We can see that the ratio of narration has a negative correlation, which means just narrating stories without auxiliary discourse modes would lead to poor scores.", 
        "244": "The description mode ratio has the strongest positive correlation to essay scores.", 
        "245": "This may indicate that using vivid language to provide detail information is essential in writing narrative essays.", 
        "246": "Emotion expressing also has a positive correlation.", 
        "247": "It is reasonable since emotional writing can involve readers into the stories.", 
        "248": "The ratio of argument shows a negative correlation.", 
        "249": "The reason may be that: first, the identification of argument is not good enough; second, the existence of an argument doesn\u2019t mean the quality of argumentation is good.", 
        "250": "Exposition has little effect on essay scores.", 
        "251": "Generally, the distribution of discourse modes shows correlations to the quality of essays.", 
        "252": "This may relate to the difficulties of manipulating different discourse modes.", 
        "253": "It is easy for students to use narration, but it is more difficult to manipulate description and emotion expressing well.", 
        "254": "As a result, the ability of descriptive and emotional writ-  100 200 400 600  ing should be an indicator of language proficiency and can better distinguish the quality of writing.", 
        "255": "Impact on scoring essays with various length: It is easy to understand that length is a strong indicator for essay scoring.", 
        "256": "It is interesting to study that when the effect of length becomes weaker, e.g., the lengths of essays are close, how does the performance of the AES system change?", 
        "257": "We conducted experiments on essays with various lengths.", 
        "258": "Only essays that the length is no less than a given threshold are selected for evaluation.", 
        "259": "The threshold is set to 100, 200, 400 and 600 Chinese characters respectively.", 
        "260": "We ran 5-fold crossvalidation with BLRR on the datasets after essay selection.", 
        "261": "Figure 3 shows the results on three datasets.", 
        "262": "We can see the following trends: (1) The QWK scores decrease along with shorter essays are removed gradually; (2) Adding discourse mode features always improves the performance; (3) As the threshold becomes larger, the improvements by adding discourse mode features become larger.", 
        "263": "The results indicate that the current AES system can achieve a high correlation score when the lengths of essays differ obviously.", 
        "264": "Even the simple features like length can judge that short essays tend to have low scores.", 
        "265": "However, when the lengths of essays are close, AES would face greater challenges, because it is required to deeper understand the properties of well written essays.", 
        "266": "In such situations, features that can model more advanced aspects of writing, such as discourse modes, should play a more important role.", 
        "267": "It should be also essential for evaluating essays written in the native language of the writer, when spelling and grammar are not big issues any more.", 
        "268": "6 Conclusion  This paper has introduced a fundamental but less studied task in NLP\u2014discourse mode identification, which is designed in this work to automatically identify five discourse modes in essays.", 
        "269": "A corpus of narrative student essays was manually annotated with discourse modes at sentence level, with acceptable inter-annotator agreement.", 
        "270": "The corpus analysis revealed several aspects of characteristics of discourse modes including the distribution, co-occurrence and transition patterns.", 
        "271": "Considering these characteristics, we proposed a neural sequence labeling approach for identifying discourse modes.", 
        "272": "The experimental results demonstrate that automatic discourse mode identification is feasible.", 
        "273": "We evaluated discourse mode features for automatic essay scoring and draw preliminary observations.", 
        "274": "Discourse mode features can make positive contributions, especially in challenging situations when simple surface features don\u2019t work well.", 
        "275": "The ratio of description and emotion expressing is shown to be positively correlated to essay scores.", 
        "276": "In future, we plan to exploit discourse mode identification for providing novel features for more downstream NLP applications.",

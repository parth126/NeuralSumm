        "6": "For example, POS tags can be projected via word alignments, and the projected POS is then used to train a model in the lowresource language (Das and Petrov, 2011; Zhang et al., 2016; Fang and Cohn, 2016).", 
        "7": "These methods overall have limited effectiveness due to errors in the alignment and fundamental differences between the languages.",

        "9": "To address these limitations, we propose a new technique for low resource tagging, with more modest resource requirements: 1) a bilingual dictionary; 2) monolingual corpora in the high and low resource languages; and 3) a small annotated corpus of around 1, 000 tokens in the low-resource language.",

        "52": "Consider the training effect of the true POS tags: when performing error backpropagation, the cross-entropy error signal must pass through the transformation linking o\u0303with o, which can be seen as a language-specific step, after which the generalised error signal can be further backpropagated to the rest of the model.", 
        "53": "Active learning Given the scarcity of ground truth labels and the high cost of annotation, a natural question is whether we can optimise which text to be annotated in order achieve the high accuracy for the lowest cost.",

        "2": "A rating scale provides the annotator with a choice of categorical or numerical values that represent the measurable characteristic of the rated data.", 
        "3": "For example, when annotating a word for sentiment, the annotator can be asked to choose among integer values from 1 to 9, with 1 representing the strongest negative sentiment, and 9 representing the strongest positive sentiment (Bradley and Lang, 1999; Warriner et al., 2013).", 
        "4": "Another example is the Likert scale, which measures responses on a symmetric agree\u2013disagree scale, from \u2018strongly disagree\u2019 to \u2018strongly agree\u2019 (Likert, 1932).", 
        "5": "The annotations for an item from multiple respondents are usually averaged to obtain a real-valued score for that item.", 
        "6": "Thus, for an N -\nitem set, if each item is to be annotated by five respondents, then the number of annotations required is 5N .", 
        "7": "While frequently used in many disciplines, the rating scale method has a number of limitations (Presser and Schuman, 1996; Baumgartner and Steenkamp, 2001).", 
        "8": "These include:\n\u2022 Inconsistencies in annotations by different annotators: one annotator might assign a score of 7 to the word good on a 1-to-9 sentiment scale, while another annotator can assign a score of 8 to the same word.", 
        "9": "\u2022 Inconsistencies in annotations by the same annotator: an annotator might assign different scores to the same item when the annotations are spread over time.",

        "11": "\u2022 Fixed granularity: in some cases, annotators might feel too restricted with a given rating scale and may want to place an item inbetween the two points on the scale.", 
        "12": "On the other hand, a fine-grained scale may overwhelm the respondents and lead to even more inconsistencies in annotation.", 
        "13": "Paired Comparisons (Thurstone, 1927; David, 1963) is a comparative annotation method, where respondents are presented with pairs of items and asked which item has more of the property of interest (for example, which is more positive).", 
        "14": "The annotations can then be converted into a ranking of items by the property of interest, and one can even obtain real-valued scores indicating the degree to which an item is associated with the property of interest.", 
        "15": "The paired comparison method does not suffer from the problems discussed above for the rating scale, but it requires a large number of annotations\u2014orderN2, whereN is the number of items to be annotated.",

        "18": "Annotators are presented with n items at a time (an n-tuple, where n > 1, and typically n = 4).", 
        "19": "They are asked which item is the best (highest in terms of the property of interest) and which is the worst (lowest in terms of the property of interest).", 
        "20": "When working on 4-tuples, best\u2013worst annotations are particularly efficient because by answering these two questions, the results for five out of six item\u2013item pair-wise comparisons become known.", 
        "21": "All items to be rated are organized in a set of m 4-tuples (m \u2265 N , where N is the number of items) so that each item is evaluated several times in diverse 4-tuples.", 
        "22": "Once the m 4-tuples are annotated, one can compute real-valued scores for each of the items using a simple counting procedure (Orme, 2009).", 
        "23": "The scores can be used to rank items by the property of interest.", 
        "24": "BWS is claimed to produce high-quality annotations while still keeping the number of annotations small (1.5N\u20132N tuples need to be annotated) (Louviere et al., 2015; Kiritchenko and Mohammad, 2016a).", 
        "25": "However, the veracity of this claim has never been systematically established.", 
        "26": "In this paper, we pit the widely used rating scale squarely against BWS in a quantitative experiment to determine which method provides more reliable results.", 
        "27": "We produce real-valued sentiment intensity ratings for 3,207 English terms (words and phrases) using both methods by aggregating responses from several independent annotators.", 
        "28": "We show that BWS ranks terms more reliably, that is, when comparing the term rankings obtained from two groups of annotators for the same set of terms, the correlation between the two sets of ranks produced by BWS is significantly higher than the correlation for the two sets obtained with RS.", 
        "29": "The difference in reliability is more marked when about 5N (or less) total annotations are obtained, which is the case in many NLP annotation projects (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007; Socher et al., 2013; Mohammad and Turney, 2013).", 
        "30": "Furthermore, the reliability obtained by rating scale when using ten annotations per term is matched by BWS with only 3N total annotations (two annotations for each of the 1.5N 4-tuples).", 
        "31": "The sparse prior work in natural language annotations that uses BWS involves the creation of datasets for relational similarity (Jurgens et al., 2012), word-sense disambiguation (Jurgens, 2013), and word\u2013sentiment intensity (Kiritchenko and Mohammad, 2016a).", 
        "32": "However, none of these works has systematically compared BWS with the rating scale method.", 
        "33": "We hope that our findings will encourage the use of BWS more widely to obtain high-quality NLP annotations.", 
        "34": "All data from our experiments as well as scripts to generate BWS tuples, to generate item scores from BWS annotations, and for assessing reliability of the annotations are made freely available.1  2 Complexities of Comparative Evaluation  Both rating scale and BWS are less than perfect ways to capture the true word\u2013sentiment intensities in the minds of native speakers of a language.", 
        "35": "Since the \u201ctrue\u201d intensities are not known, determining which approach is better is non-trivial.2\nA useful measure of quality is reproducibility\u2014 if repeated independent manual annotations from multiple respondents result in similar sentiment scores, then one can be confident that the scores capture the true sentiment intensities.", 
        "36": "Thus, we set up an experiment that compares BWS and RS in terms of how similar the results are on repeated independent annotations.", 
        "37": "It is expected that reproducibility improves with the number of annotations for both methods.", 
        "38": "(Estimating a value often stabilizes as the sample size is increased.)", 
        "39": "However, in rating scale annotation, each item is annotated individually whereas in BWS, groups of four items (4-tuples) are annotated together (and each item is present in multiple different 4-tuples).", 
        "40": "To make the reproducibility evaluation fair, we ensure that the term scores are inferred from the same total number of annotations for both methods.", 
        "41": "For an N -item set, let krs be the number of times each item is annotated via a rating scale.",

        "49": "On the other hand, even though a rating scale question explicitly involves only one item, the respondent must choose a score that places it appropriately with respect to other items.3 Quantifying the degree of cognitive load of a BWS annotation vs. a rating scale annotation (especially in a crowdsourcing setting) is particularly challenging, and beyond the scope of this paper.", 
        "50": "Here we explore the extent to which the rating scale method and BWS lead to the same resulting scores when the annotations are repeated, controlling for the total number of annotations.", 
        "51": "3 Annotating for Sentiment  We annotated 3,207 terms for sentiment intensity (or degree of positive or negative valence) with both the rating scale and best\u2013worst scaling.",

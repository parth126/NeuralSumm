        "109": "Generally, we observe that adding bigram and trigram fixations in the shared regime leads to performance improvements compared to using unigram features only.", 
        "110": "This trend does not hold for the individual sentences, presumably due to a combination of feature sparsity and context variation in this regime.", 
        "111": "We also note that IC and SC features tend to perform better together than in separation, suggesting that the information encoded using these feature-sets is to some extent complementary.",

        "161": "This form exists in English (e.g.", 
        "162": "\u201cthe confidence of the public\u201d) and is preferred by speakers of these languages in ESL writing (Nagata and Whittaker, 2013).", 
        "163": "As an additional baseline for this construction, we provide the TF times for NN in figure 2d.", 
        "164": "There, relative to English natives, we observe longer reading times for Japanese and Chinese and comparable times for Portuguese and Spanish.", 
        "165": "The reading times of NN in figure 2d also give\nrise to a second, potentially competing interpretation of differences in ESL reading times, which highlights lexical rather than structural factors.", 
        "166": "According to this interpretation, increased reading times of nouns are the result of substantially smaller lexical sharing with English by Chinese and Japanese as compared to Spanish and Portuguese.", 
        "167": "Given the utilized speed normalization, lexical effects on nouns could in principle account for reduced reading times on determiners and pronouns.", 
        "168": "Conversely, structural influence leading to reduced reading times on determiners and pronouns could explain longer dwelling on nouns.", 
        "169": "A third possibility consistent with the observed reading patterns would allow for both structural and lexical effects to impact second language reading.", 
        "170": "Importantly, in each of these scenarios, ESL reading patterns are related to linguistic factors of the reader\u2019s native language.", 
        "171": "We note that the presented analysis is preliminary in nature, and warrants further study in future research.", 
        "172": "In particular, reading times and classifier learned features may in some cases differ between the shared and the individual regimes.", 
        "173": "In the examples presented above, similar results are obtained in the individual sentences regime for DT, PRP and NN.", 
        "174": "The trend for the NN+POS construction, however, diminishes in that setup with similar reading times for all languages.", 
        "175": "On the other hand, one of the strongest features for predicting Portuguese and Spanish in the individual regime are longer reading times for prepositions (IN), an outcome that holds in the shared regime only relative to Chinese and Japanese, but not relative to native speakers of English.", 
        "176": "Despite these caveats, our results suggest that reading patterns can potentially be related to linguistic factors of the reader\u2019s native language.", 
        "177": "This analysis can be extended in various ways, such as inclusion of additional feature types and fixation metrics, as well as utilization of other comparative methodologies.", 
        "178": "Combined with evidence from language production, this line of investigation can be instrumental for informing linguistic theory of cross-linguistic influence.", 
        "179": "5 Related Work  Eyetracking and second language reading Second language reading has been studied using eyetracking, with much of the work focusing on processing of syntactic ambiguities and analysis\nof specific target word classes such as cognates (Dussias, 2010; Roberts and Siyanova-Chanturia, 2013).", 
        "180": "In contrast to our work, such studies typically use controlled, rather than free-form sentences.", 
        "181": "Investigation of global metrics in freeform second language reading was introduced only recently by Cop et al.", 
        "182": "(2015).", 
        "183": "This study compared ESL and native reading of a novel by native speakers of Dutch, observing longer sentence reading times, more fixations and shorter saccades in ESL reading.", 
        "184": "Differently from this study, our work focuses on comparison of reading patterns between different native languages.", 
        "185": "We also analyze a related, but different metric, namely speed normalized fixation durations on word sequences.", 
        "186": "Eyetracking for NLP tasks Recent work in NLP has demonstrated that reading gaze can serve as a valuable supervision signal for standard NLP tasks.", 
        "187": "Prominent examples of such work include POS tagging (Barrett and S\u00f8gaard, 2015a; Barrett et al., 2016), syntactic parsing (Barrett and S\u00f8gaard, 2015b) and sentence compression (Klerke et al., 2016).", 
        "188": "Our work also tackles a traditional NLP task with free-form text, but differs from this line of research in that it addresses this task only in comprehension.", 
        "189": "Furthermore, while these studies use gaze recordings of native readers, our work focuses on non-native readers.", 
        "190": "NLI in production NLI was first introduced in Koppel et al.", 
        "191": "(2005) and has been drawing considerable attention in NLP, including a recent shared-task challenge with 29 participating teams (Tetreault et al., 2013).", 
        "192": "NLI has also been driving much of the work on identification of native language related features in writing (Tsur and Rappoport, 2007; Jarvis and Crossley, 2012; Brooke and Hirst, 2012; Tetreault et al., 2012; Swanson and Charniak, 2013, 2014; Malmasi and Dras, 2014; Bykh and Meurers, 2016).", 
        "193": "Several studies have also linked usage patterns and grammatical errors in production to linguistic properties of the writer\u2019s native language (Nagata and Whittaker, 2013; Nagata, 2014; Berzak et al., 2014, 2015).", 
        "194": "Our work departs from NLI in writing and introduces NLI and related feature analysis in reading.", 
        "195": "6 Conclusion and Outlook  We present a novel framework for studying crosslinguistic influence in multilingualism by measuring gaze fixations during reading of free-form En-\nglish text.", 
        "196": "We demonstrate for the first time that this signal can be used to determine a reader\u2019s native language.", 
        "197": "The effectiveness of linguistically motivated criteria for fixation clustering and our subsequent analysis suggest that the ESL reading process is affected by linguistic factors.", 
        "198": "Specifically, we show that linguistic similarities between native languages are reflected in similarities in ESL reading.", 
        "199": "We also identify several key features that characterize reading in different native languages, and discuss their potential connection to structural and lexical properties of the native langauge.", 
        "200": "The presented results demonstrate that eyetracking data can be instrumental for developing predictive and explanatory models of second language reading.", 
        "201": "While this work is focused on NLIR from fixations, our general framework can be used to address additional aspects of reading, such as analysis of saccades and gaze trajectories.", 
        "202": "In future work, we also plan to explore the role of native and second language writing system characteristics in second language reading.", 
        "203": "More broadly, our methodology introduces parallels with production studies in NLP, creating new opportunities for integration of data, methodologies and tasks between production and comprehension.", 
        "204": "Furthermore, it holds promise for formulating language learning theory that is supported by empirical findings in naturalistic setups across language processing domains.",

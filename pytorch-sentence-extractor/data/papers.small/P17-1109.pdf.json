        "237": "It is meant to make predictions about unseen languages.", 
        "238": "Whether human language learners exploit any properties of this distribution10 is a separate question that goes beyond typology.", 
        "239": "Jakobson (1941) did find that children acquired phoneme inventories in an order that reflected principles similar to dispersion (\u201cmaximum contrast\u201d) and focalization.", 
        "240": "At any rate, we estimate the distribution given some set of attested systems that are assumed to have been drawn IID from it.", 
        "241": "One might object that this IID assumption ignores evolutionary relationships among the attested systems, causing our estimated distribution to favor systems that are coincidentally frequent among current human languages, rather than being natural in some timeless sense.", 
        "242": "We reply that our approach is then appropriate when the goal of typology is to estimate the distribution of actual human languages\u2014a distribution that can be utilized in principle (and also in practice, as we show) to predict properties of actual languages from outside the training set.", 
        "243": "A different possible goal of typology is a theory of natural human languages.", 
        "244": "This goal would require a more complex approach.",

        "258": "This does not match reality\u2014the empirical distribution over inventory sizes (shown in Figure 5) shows that the mode is actually 5 and small inventories are uncommon: no 1-vowel inventory is attested and only one 2-vowel inventory is known.",

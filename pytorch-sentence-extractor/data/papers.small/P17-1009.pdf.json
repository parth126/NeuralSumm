        "9": "These trigger detection errors could severely harm event coreference performance.", 
        "10": "For instance, two event mentions could be wrongly posited as coreferent if the underlying triggers were wrongly predicted to have the same subtype.",

        "47": "It is worth mentioning that the KBP Event Nugget Detection and Coreference task, which started in 2015, aims to address a major weakness of the ACE 2005 event coreference task.", 
        "48": "Specifically, ACE 2005 adopts a strict notion of event identity, with which two event mentions were annotated as coreferent if and only if \u201cthey had the same agent(s), patient(s), time, and location\u201d (Song et al., 2015), and their event attributes (polarity, modality, genericity, and tense) were not incompatible.",

        "131": "However, since the coreference annotation for each document i is provided in the form of a clustering C\u2217i , we follow previous work on entity coreference resolution (Durrett and Klein, 2013): we sum over all antecedent structures A(C\u2217i ) that are consistent with C\u2217i (i.e., the first mention of a cluster has antecedent NEW, whereas each of the subsequent mentions can select any of the preceding mentions in the same cluster as its antecedent).",

        "5": "On the other hand, sophisticated abilities that are crucial to high-quality summarization, such as paraphrasing, generalization, or the incorporation of real-world knowledge, are possible only in an abstractive framework (see Figure 5).",

        "7": "However, the recent success of sequence-to-sequence models (Sutskever\n1073\net al., 2014), in which recurrent neural networks (RNNs) both read and freely generate text, has made abstractive summarization viable (Chopra et al., 2016; Nallapati et al., 2016; Rush et al., 2015; Zeng et al., 2016).", 
        "8": "Though these systems are promising, they exhibit undesirable behavior such as inaccurately reproducing factual details, an inability to deal with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, and repeating themselves (see Figure 1).",

        "10": "While most recent abstractive work has focused on headline generation tasks (reducing one or two sentences to a single headline), we believe that longer-text summarization is both more challenging (requiring higher levels of abstraction while avoiding repetition) and ultimately more useful.",

This ensures that the attention mechanism\u2019s current decision (choosing where to attend next) is informed by a reminder of its previous decisions (summarized in ct).", 
        "39": "This should make it easier for the attention mechanism to avoid repeatedly attending to the same locations, and thus avoid generating repetitive text.", 
        "40": "We find it necessary (see section 5) to additionally define a coverage loss to penalize repeatedly attending to the same locations:\ncovlosst = \u2211i min(ati,cti) (12) Note that the coverage loss is bounded; in particular covlosst \u2264\u2211i ati = 1.",

        "43": "Our loss function is more flexible: because summarization should not require uniform coverage, we only penalize the overlap between each attention distribution and the coverage so far \u2013 preventing repeated attention.",

        "137": "7 Discussion    7.1 Comparison with extractive systems  It is clear from Table 1 that extractive systems tend to achieve higher ROUGE scores than abstractive, and that the extractive lead-3 baseline is extremely strong (even the best extractive system beats it by only a small margin).", 
        "138": "We offer two possible explanations for these observations.", 
        "139": "Firstly, news articles tend to be structured with the most important information at the start; this partially explains the strength of the lead-3 baseline.", 
        "140": "Indeed, we found that using only the first 400 tokens (about 20 sentences) of the article yielded significantly higher ROUGE scores than using the first 800 tokens.", 
        "141": "Secondly, the nature of the task and the ROUGE metric make extractive approaches and the lead3 baseline difficult to beat.", 
        "142": "The choice of content for the reference summaries is quite subjective \u2013 sometimes the sentences form a self-contained summary; other times they simply showcase a few interesting details from the article.", 
        "143": "Given that the articles contain 39 sentences on average, there are many equally valid ways to choose 3 or 4 highlights in this style.", 
        "144": "Abstraction introduces even more options (choice of phrasing), further decreas-\ning the likelihood of matching the reference summary.", 
        "145": "For example, smugglers profit from desperate migrants is a valid alternative abstractive summary for the first example in Figure 5, but it scores 0 ROUGE with respect to the reference summary.", 
        "146": "This inflexibility of ROUGE is exacerbated by only having one reference summary, which has been shown to lower ROUGE\u2019s reliability compared to multiple reference summaries (Lin, 2004a).", 
        "147": "Due to the subjectivity of the task and thus the diversity of valid summaries, it seems that ROUGE rewards safe strategies such as selecting the first-appearing content, or preserving original phrasing.", 
        "148": "While the reference summaries do sometimes deviate from these techniques, those deviations are unpredictable enough that the safer strategy obtains higher ROUGE scores on average.", 
        "149": "This may explain why extractive systems tend to obtain higher ROUGE scores than abstractive, and even extractive systems do not significantly exceed the lead-3 baseline.", 
        "150": "To explore this issue further, we evaluated our systems with the METEOR metric, which rewards not only exact word matches, but also matching stems, synonyms and paraphrases (from a predefined list).", 
        "151": "We observe that all our models receive over 1 METEOR point boost by the inclusion of stem, synonym and paraphrase matching, indicating that they may be performing some abstraction.", 
        "152": "However, we again observe that the lead-3 baseline is not surpassed by our models.", 
        "153": "It may be that news article style makes the lead3 baseline very strong with respect to any metric.", 
        "154": "We believe that investigating this issue further is an important direction for future work.", 
        "155": "7.2 How abstractive is our model?", 
        "156": "We have shown that our pointer mechanism makes our abstractive system more reliable, copying factual details correctly more often.", 
        "157": "But does the ease of copying make our system any less abstractive?", 
        "158": "Figure 6 shows that our final model\u2019s summaries contain a much lower rate of novel n-grams (i.e., those that don\u2019t appear in the article) than the reference summaries, indicating a lower degree of abstraction.", 
        "159": "Note that the baseline model produces novel n-grams more frequently \u2013 however, this statistic includes all the incorrectly copied words, UNK tokens and fabrications alongside the good instances of abstraction.", 
        "160": "In particular, Figure 6 shows that our final model copies whole article sentences 35% of the time; by comparison the reference summaries do so only 1.3% of the time.", 
        "161": "This is a main area for improvement, as we would like our model to move beyond simple sentence extraction.", 
        "162": "However, we observe that the other 65% encompasses a range of abstractive techniques.", 
        "163": "Article sentences are truncated to form grammatically-correct shorter versions, and new sentences are composed by stitching together fragments.", 
        "164": "Unnecessary interjections, clauses and parenthesized phrases are sometimes omitted from copied passages.", 
        "165": "Some of these abilities are demonstrated in Figure 1, and the supplementary material contains more examples.", 
        "166": "Figure 7 shows two examples of more impressive abstraction \u2013 both with similar structure.", 
        "167": "The dataset contains many sports stories whose summaries follow the X beat Y \u3008score\u3009 on \u3008day\u3009 tem-\nplate, which may explain why our model is most confidently abstractive on these examples.", 
        "168": "In general however, our model does not routinely produce summaries like those in Figure 7, and is not close to producing summaries like in Figure 5.", 
        "169": "The value of the generation probability pgen also gives a measure of the abstractiveness of our model.", 
        "170": "During training, pgen starts with a value of about 0.30 then increases, converging to about 0.53 by the end of training.", 
        "171": "This indicates that the model first learns to mostly copy, then learns to generate about half the time.", 
        "172": "However at test time, pgen is heavily skewed towards copying, with a mean value of 0.17.", 
        "173": "The disparity is likely due to the fact that during training, the model receives word-by-word supervision in the form of the reference summary, but at test time it does not.", 
        "174": "Nonetheless, the generator module is useful even when the model is copying.", 
        "175": "We find that pgen is highest at times of uncertainty such as the beginning of sentences, the join between stitched-together fragments, and when producing periods that truncate a copied sentence.", 
        "176": "Our mixture model allows the network to copy while simultaneously consulting the language model \u2013 enabling operations like stitching and truncation to be performed with grammaticality.", 
        "177": "In any case, encouraging the pointer-generator model to write more abstractively, while retaining the accuracy advantages of the pointer module, is an exciting direction for future work.", 
        "178": "8 Conclusion  In this work we presented a hybrid pointergenerator architecture with coverage, and showed that it reduces inaccuracies and repetition.", 
        "179": "We applied our model to a new and challenging longtext dataset, and significantly outperformed the abstractive state-of-the-art result.", 
        "180": "Our model exhibits many abstractive abilities, but attaining higher levels of abstraction remains an open research question.", 
        "181": "9 Acknowledgment  We thank the ACL reviewers for their helpful comments.",

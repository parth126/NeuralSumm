        "12": "For example, rule-based methods (Zhou et al., 2010), statistical machine translation (SMT) models (Jiang and Zhou, 2008; He et al., 2012) and neural models (Zhang and Lapata, 2014; Wang et al., 2016a,c).",

        "18": "This is particularly true for Chinese quatrains that are highly compact and expressive: it is nearly impossible to find two similar works in the thousands of years of history in this genre, demonstrating the importance of uniqueness or innovation.", 
        "19": "Ironically, the most important thing, innovation, is largely treated as trivial, if not noise, by present neural models.", 
        "20": "Actually this problem is shared by all generation models based on statistics (although it is more serious for neural models) and has aroused a long-standing criticism for machine poem generation: it can generate, and sometimes generate well, but the generation tends to be unsurprising and not particularly interesting.",

        "26": "This is like a human poet who creates poems by not only referring to common rules and patterns, but also recalls poems that he has read before.", 
        "27": "It is hard to say whether this combination of rules and instances produces true innovation\n(which often requires real-life motivation rather than simple word reordering), but it indeed offers interesting flexibility to generate new outputs that look creative and are still rule-compliant.",

        "29": "In this paper, we use the memory-augmented neural model to generate flexible and creative Chinese poems.", 
        "30": "We investigate three scenarios where adding a memory may contribute: the first scenario involves a well trained neural model where we aim to promote innovation by adding a memory, the second scenario involves an over-fitted neural model where we hope the memory can regularize the innovation, and in the third scenario, the memory is used to encourage generation of poems of different styles.",

        "108": "Due to the overfitting, we observe that with the one-iteration model, reasonable poems can be generated, and with the over-fitted model, the generated poems are meaningless, in that they do not resemble feasible character sequences.",

        "169": "The evaluation was conducted online, with each questionnaire containing 11 questions focusing on innovation and 4 questions concerned with style-transfer.", 
        "170": "Each of the style-transfer questions presented the expert with a single poem and asked them to score it between 1 to 5, with a larger score being better, in terms of compliance, aesthetic innovation,\n3http://vivi.cslt.org\nscenario consistency, and fluency.", 
        "171": "They were also asked to specify the style of the poem.", 
        "172": "Using the poems generated by our systems, we generated many different questions of both types, and then created a number of online questionnaires that randomly selected from these questions.", 
        "173": "This meant that as discussed above, each questionnaire had 11 randomly selected innovation questions, and 4 randomly selected style transfer questions.", 
        "174": "Each question was only used once, meaning that it was not duplicated on multiple questionnaires, and so each questionnaire was different.", 
        "175": "Experts could choose to answer multiple questionnaires if they wished, as each one was different.", 
        "176": "From the 34 experts, we collected 69 completed questionnaires, which equals to 759 innovation questions and 276 style-transfer questions.", 
        "177": "5.3 Innovation experiment  This experiment focuses on the contribution of memory for innovative poem generation.", 
        "178": "We experimented with two configurations: one is with a one-iteration model (C1) and the other is with an overfitted model (C\u221e).", 
        "179": "The memory was generated from the 500 quatrains in MEM-I, and the weighting factor was defined empirically as 16 for C1 and 49 for C\u221e.", 
        "180": "The topics of the generation were 160 keywords randomly selected from Shixuhanyinge (Liu, 1735).", 
        "181": "Given a pair of poems generated by two different configurations using the same topic, the experts were asked to choose which one they preferred.", 
        "182": "The evaluation is therefore pair-wised, and each pair of configurations contains at least 180 evaluations.", 
        "183": "The results are shown in Table 2, where the preference ratio for each pair of configurations was tested in terms of the 5 metrics.", 
        "184": "From the first row of Table 2, we observe that the experts have a clear preference for the poems generated by the C1 model, the one that can produce fluent yet uninteresting poems.", 
        "185": "In particular, the \u2018aesthetic innovation\u2019 score for C\u221e is not better than C1, which was different from what we expected.", 
        "186": "Informal offline discussions with the poetry experts found that the experts identified some innovative expression in the C\u221e condition, but most of the them was regarded as being nonsense in the opinion of many of the experts.", 
        "187": "In comparison to sparking innovation, fluency and being meaningful is more important not only for non-expert readers, but also for professional poet-\ns. In other words, only meaningful innovation is regarded as innovation, and irrational innovation is simply treated as junk.", 
        "188": "From the second and third rows of Table 2, it can be seen that involving memory significantly improves both C1 and C\u221e, particularly for C\u221e.", 
        "189": "For C1, the most substantial improvement is observed in terms of \u2018Aesthetic innovation\u2019, which is consistent with our argument that memory can help encourage innovation for this model.", 
        "190": "For C\u221e, \u2018Fluency\u2019 seems to be the most improved metric.", 
        "191": "This is also consistent with our argument that involving memory constrains over-innovation for over-fitted models.", 
        "192": "The last row of Table 2 is an extra experiment that investigates if C\u221e is regularized well enough after introducing the memory.", 
        "193": "It seems that with the regularization, the overfitting problem is largely solved, and the generation is nearly as fluent and consistent as the C1 condition.", 
        "194": "Interestingly, the score for aesthetic innovation is also significantly improved.", 
        "195": "Since the regularization is not supposed to boost innovation, this seems confusing at first glance (in comparison to the result on the same metric in the first row), but this is probably because the increased fluency and consistency makes the innovation more appreciated, therefore doubly confirming our argument that true innovation should be reasonable and meaningful.", 
        "196": "5.4 Style-transfer experiment  In the second experiment, the memory mechanism is used to generate poems in different styles.", 
        "197": "We chose three styles: pastoral, battlefield, and romantic.", 
        "198": "A style-specific memory, which we call style memory, was constructed for each style by the corresponding quatrains in the MEM-S dataset.", 
        "199": "The system with one-iteration model C1 was used as the baseline.", 
        "200": "Two sets of topics were used in the experiment, one is general and the other is style-biased.", 
        "201": "The experiments then investigate if the memory mechanism can produce a clear style if the topic is general, and can transfer to a\ndifferent style if the topic is style-biased already.", 
        "202": "The experts were asked to specify the style from four options including the three defined above and a \u2018unclear style\u2019 option.", 
        "203": "In addition, the experts were asked to score the poems in terms of compliance, fluency, aesthetic innovation, and scenario consistency, which we can use to check if the style transfer impacts the quality of the poem generation.", 
        "204": "Note that we did not ask for the theme consistency to be scored in this experiment because the topic words were not presented to the experts, in order to prevent the topic affecting their judgment regarding the style.", 
        "205": "The score ranges from 1 to 5, with a larger score being better.", 
        "206": "Table 3 presents the results with the general topics.", 
        "207": "The numbers show the probabilities that the poems generated by a particular system were labeled as having various styles.", 
        "208": "Since the topics are unbiased in types, the generation of the baseline system is assumed to be with unclear styles.", 
        "209": "For other systems, the style of the generation is assumed to be the same as the style of their memories.", 
        "210": "The results in Table 3 clearly demonstrates these assumptions.", 
        "211": "The tendency that romantic poems are recognized as pastoral poems is a little surprising.", 
        "212": "Further analysis shows that experts tend to recognize romantic poems as pastoral poems only if there are any related symbols such as trees, mountain, river.", 
        "213": "These words are very general in Chinese quatrains.", 
        "214": "The indicator words of romantic poems such as skirt, rouge, and singing are not as popular and their indication power is not as strong, leading to less labeling of romantic poems, as shown in the results.", 
        "215": "We also tested transferring from one style to\nanother.", 
        "216": "This was achieved by generating poems with some style-biased topics, and then using a style memory to force the generation to change the style.", 
        "217": "Our experiments show that in 73% cases the style can be successfully transferred.", 
        "218": "Finally, the scores of the poems generated with and without the style memories are shown in Table 4, where the poems generated with both general and style-biased topics are accounted for.", 
        "219": "It can be seen that overall, the style transfer may degrade fluency a little.", 
        "220": "This is understandable, as enforcing a particular style has to break the optimal generation with the baseline, which is assumed to be good at generating fluent poems.", 
        "221": "Nevertheless the sacrifice is not significant.", 
        "222": "5.5 Examples  Table 5 to Table 7 shows example poems generated by the system C1, C1+Mem and C1+Style Mem where the style in this case is set to be romantic.", 
        "223": "The three poems were generated with the same, very general, topic (\u2018g(oneself)\u2019).", 
        "224": "More examples are given in the supporting material.", 
        "225": "6 Conclusions  In this paper, we proposed a memory mechanism to support innovative Chinese poem generation by neural models augmented with a memory.", 
        "226": "Experimental results demonstrated that memory can boost innovation from two opposite di-\nrections: either by encouraging creative generation for regularly-trained models, or by encouraging rule-compliance for overfitted models.", 
        "227": "Both strategies work well, although the former generated poetry that was preferred by experts in our experiments.", 
        "228": "Furthermore, we found that the memory can be used to modify the style of the generated poems in a flexible way.", 
        "229": "The experts we collaborated with feel that the present generation is comparable to today\u2019s experienced amateur poets.", 
        "230": "Future work involves investigating a better memory selection scheme.", 
        "231": "Other regularization methods (e.g., norm or drop out) are also interesting and may alleviate the over-fitting problem.",

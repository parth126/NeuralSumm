        "167": "This can be partly due to not being trained on large enough comparison training dataset.", 
        "168": "The semantic model, however, could outperform the neural models using the same amount of data.", 
        "169": "To a degree, this is because the semantic model leverages the basic language understanding capabilities offered by the semantic parser.", 
        "170": "It is also important to note that our semantic approach is not only capable of binary and open-ended prediction, but it also offers two byproducts that can be used as knowledge in a variety of other tasks: (1) a set of the most important absolute information frames which can be chosen based on feature importance in the classification, (2) the partial ordering lattice of entities.", 
        "171": "Overall, the results strongly suggest that the GuessTwo task is challenging, with the open-ended scheme being the most challenging.", 
        "172": "There is a wide gap between human and system performance on this task, which makes it a very promising task for the community to pursue.", 
        "173": "7 Related Work  The task of Machine Comprehension (MC) has gained a significant attention over the past few years.", 
        "174": "The major driver for MC has been the publicly available benchmarking datasets.", 
        "175": "A variety of MC tasks have been introduced in the community (Richardson et al.", 
        "176": "; Hermann et al., 2015; Rajpurkar et al., 2016; Hill et al., 2015), in which the system reads a short text and answers a few multiple-choice questions.", 
        "177": "The reading comprehension involved in these tests ranges from reading a short fictional story (Richardson et al.)", 
        "178": "to reading a short news article (Hermann et al., 2015).", 
        "179": "In comparison, in the GuessTwo task the reading comprehension involves reading a short comparison paragraph and one can say the multiple-choice question is the constant What are X and Y?", 
        "180": "The CNN/DailyMail dataset consists of more than 100K short news articles with the questions automatically created from the bullet-point summaries of the original article.", 
        "181": "This dataset uses fill-in-the-blank-style questions such as \u2018Producer X will not press charges against Jeremy Clarkson\u2019 where the system should choose among all the anonymized entities in the corresponding paragraph to fill in X.", 
        "182": "The Stanford Question Answering (SQuAD) dataset is another recent machine comprehension test with over 500 Wikipedia articles and +100,000 crowdsourced questions.", 
        "183": "The answer to every question in this dataset is a span of text from the corresponding reading passage.", 
        "184": "Human accuracy on CNN/DailyMail is estimated to be around 75% (Chen et al., 2016) with the current state-of-the-art at 76.1 on CNN (Sordoni et al., 2016), and 75.8 on DailyMail (Chen et al., 2016).", 
        "185": "The human F1 score on SQuAD\ndataset is reported to be at 86.8%, with the current state-of-the-art achieving 82.9%.", 
        "186": "Given these statistics, neither of these datasets leave enough room for further research.", 
        "187": "Given that in both these tasks the answer to the question is directly found in the provided passage, we argue that the community requires a more challenging MC task which goes beyond matching and needs some level of inference across passages.", 
        "188": "The GuessTwo task requires basic reasoning and inference across paragraphs for comprehending various aspects of entities relative to one another.", 
        "189": "Another interesting task is MCTest (Richardson et al.", 
        "190": "), which is a reading comprehension test with 660 fictional stories as the passage and four questions per story.", 
        "191": "The human-level performance on MCTest is estimated to be around 90%, with the state-of-the-art achieving an accuracy of 70% (Wang et al., 2015).", 
        "192": "MCTest is also proven to be challenging, however, given its very limited training data, further progress on the task has been hindered.", 
        "193": "Yet another relevant QA task is the Allen AI Science Challenge (Clarke et al., 2010; Schoenick et al., 2016), which is a dataset of multiple-choice questions and answers from a standardized 8th grade science exam.", 
        "194": "The questions can range from simple fact lookup to complex ones which require extensive world knowledge and commonsense reasoning.", 
        "195": "This task requires machine reading of a variety of resources such as textbooks and goes beyond reading a couple of passages.", 
        "196": "8 Conclusion  We introduced the novel task of GuessTwo, in which given a short paragraph comparing two common entities, a system should guess what the two entities are.", 
        "197": "The comparison paragraphs often have complex semantic structures which make this comprehension task demanding.", 
        "198": "Furthermore, guessing the two entities requires a system to go beyond only understanding one given passage and requires reasoning across paragraphs, which is one of the most under-explored, yet crucial, capabilities of an intelligent agent.", 
        "199": "So far, we have crowdsourced a dataset of more than 14K comparison paragraphs comparing entities from nine major categories.", 
        "200": "For benchmarking the progress, we filter a collection of these paragraphs to create a test set, on which humans perform with an accuracy of 94.2%.", 
        "201": "For contin-\nuing our data collection, we would like to have a targeted entity pair selection where we particularly collect the missing relations in our partial ordering lattice.", 
        "202": "We believe that this process can help developing more effective systems.", 
        "203": "For the most recent statistics of the dataset and the best performing systems please check this website.", 
        "204": "We presented a host of neural models and a novel semantic-driven approach for tackling the task of GuessTwo.", 
        "205": "Our experiments show that the semantic approach outperforms the neural models by a large margin.", 
        "206": "The poor performance of the neural models we experimented with can motivate designing new architectures which are capable of performing basic reasoning across paragraphs.", 
        "207": "The results strongly suggest that bridging the gap between system and human performance on this task requires models with richer language representation and reasoning capabilities.", 
        "208": "As a future work, we would like to explore the feasibility of marrying our semantic and neural models to exploit the benefits that each of them has to offer.", 
        "209": "9 Acknowledgments  This work was supported in part by Grant W911NF-15-1-0542 with the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Army Research Office (ARO).",

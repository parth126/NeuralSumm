        "2": "et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014; Sennrich et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2016), conversational/dialogue modeling (Sordoni et al., 2015; Vinyals and Le, 2015; Shang et al., 2015), document summarization (Rush et al., 2015; Nallapati et al., 2016), parsing (Andor et al., 2016) and automatic question answering (Q&A) (Weston et al., 2015; Hermann et al., 2015; Wang and Jiang, 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Trischler et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2016; Seo et al., 2016; Xiong et al., 2016).", 
        "3": "An important characteristic of all these models is that they read all the text available to them.", 
        "4": "While it is essential for certain applications, such as machine translation, this characteristic also makes it slow to apply these models to scenarios that have long input text, such as document classification or automatic Q&A.", 
        "5": "However, the fact that texts are usually written with redundancy inspires us to think about the possibility of reading selectively.", 
        "6": "In this paper, we consider the problem of understanding documents with partial reading, and propose a modification to the basic neural architectures that allows them to read input text with skipping.", 
        "7": "The main benefit of this approach is faster inference because it skips irrelevant information.", 
        "8": "An unexpected benefit of this approach is that it also helps the models generalize better.", 
        "9": "In our approach, the model is a recurrent network, which learns to predict the number of jumping steps after it reads one or several input tokens.", 
        "10": "Such a discrete model is therefore not fully differentiable, but it can be trained by a standard policy gradient algorithm, where the reward can be the accuracy or its proxy during training.", 
        "11": "In our experiments, we use the basic LSTM recurrent networks (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) as the base model and benchmark the proposed algorithm on a range of document classification or reading comprehension tasks, using various datasets such as Rotten Tomatoes (Pang\n1880\nand Lee, 2005), IMDB (Maas et al., 2011), AG News (Zhang et al., 2015) and Children\u2019s Book Test (Hill et al., 2015).", 
        "12": "We find that the proposed approach of selective reading speeds up the base model by two to six times.", 
        "13": "Surprisingly, we also observe our model beats the standard LSTM in terms of accuracy.", 
        "14": "In summary, the main contribution of our work is to design an architecture that learns to skim text and show that it is both faster and more accurate in practical applications of text processing.", 
        "15": "Our model is simple and flexible enough that we anticipate it would be able to incorporate to recurrent nets with more sophisticated structures to achieve even better performance in the future.", 
        "16": "2 Methodology  In this section, we introduce the proposed model named LSTM-Jump.", 
        "17": "We first describe its main structure, followed by the difficulty of estimating part of the model parameters because of nondifferentiability.", 
        "18": "To address this issue, we appeal to a reinforcement learning formulation and adopt a policy gradient method.", 
        "19": "2.1 Model Overview  The main architecture of the proposed model is shown in Figure 1, which is based on an LSTM recurrent neural network.", 
        "20": "Before training, the number of jumps allowed N , the number of tokens read between every two jumps R and the maximum size of jumping K are chosen ahead of time.", 
        "21": "While K is a fixed parameter of the model, N and R are hyperparameters that can vary between training and testing.", 
        "22": "Also, throughout the paper, we would use d1:p to denote a sequence d1, d2, ..., dp.", 
        "23": "In the following, we describe in detail how the model operates when processing text.", 
        "24": "Given a training example x1:T , the recurrent network will read the embedding of the first R tokens x1:R and output the hidden state.", 
        "25": "Then this state is used to compute the jumping softmax that determines a distribution over the jumping steps between 1 and K. The model then samples from this distribution a jumping step, which is used to decide the next token to be read into the model.", 
        "26": "Let \u03ba be the sampled value, then the next starting token is xR+\u03ba.", 
        "27": "Such process continues until either\na) the jump softmax samples a 0; or b) the number of jumps exceeds N ; or c) the model reaches the last token xT .", 
        "28": "After stopping, as the output, the latest hidden state is further used for predicting desired targets.", 
        "29": "How to leverage the hidden state depends on the specifics of the task at hand.", 
        "30": "For example, for classification problems in Section 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, it is directly applied to produce a softmax for classification, while in automatic Q&A problem of Section 3.4, it is used to compute the correlation with the candidate answers in order to select the best one.", 
        "31": "Figure 1 gives an example with K = 5, R = 2 and N = 10 terminating on condition a).", 
        "32": "2.2 Training with REINFORCE  Our goal for training is to estimate the parameters of LSTM and possibly word embedding, which are denoted as \u03b8m, together with the jumping action parameters \u03b8a.", 
        "33": "Once obtained, they can be used for inference.", 
        "34": "The estimation of \u03b8m is straightforward in the tasks that can be reduced as classification problems (which is essentially what our experiments cover), as the cross entropy objective J1(\u03b8m) is\ndifferentiable over \u03b8m that we can directly apply backpropagation to minimize.", 
        "35": "However, the nature of discrete jumping decisions made at every step makes it difficult to estimate \u03b8a, as cross entropy is no longer differentiable over \u03b8a.", 
        "36": "Therefore, we formulate it as a reinforcement learning problem and apply policy gradient method to train the model.", 
        "37": "Specifically, we need to maximize a reward function over \u03b8a which can be constructed as follows.", 
        "38": "Let j1:N be the jumping action sequence during the training with an example x1:T .", 
        "39": "Suppose hi is a hidden state of the LSTM right before the i-th jump ji,1 then it is a function of j1:i\u22121 and thus can be denoted as hi(j1:i\u22121).", 
        "40": "Now the jump is attained by sampling from the multinomial distribution p(ji|hi(j1:i\u22121); \u03b8a), which is determined by the jump softmax.", 
        "41": "We can receive a reward R after processing x1:T under the current jumping strategy.2 The reward should be positive if the output is favorable or non-positive otherwise.", 
        "42": "In our experiments, we choose\nR = { 1 if prediction correct; \u22121 otherwise.", 
        "43": "Then the objective function of \u03b8a we want to maximize is the expected reward under the distribution defined by the current jumping policy, i.e.,\nJ2(\u03b8a) = Ep(j1:N ;\u03b8a)[R].", 
        "44": "(1)\nwhere p(j1:N ; \u03b8a) = \u220f i p(j1:i|hi(j1:i\u22121); \u03b8a).", 
        "45": "Optimizing this objective numerically requires computing its gradient, whose exact value is intractable to obtain as the expectation is over high dimensional interaction sequences.", 
        "46": "By running S examples, an approximated gradient can be computed by the following REINFORCE algorithm (Williams, 1992):\n\u2207\u03b8aJ2(\u03b8a) = N\u2211\ni=1\nEp(j1:N ;\u03b8a)[\u2207\u03b8a log p(j1:i|hi; \u03b8a)R]\n\u2248 1 S\nS\u2211\ns=1\nN\u2211\ni=1\n[\u2207\u03b8a log p(js1:i|hsi ; \u03b8a)Rs]\nwhere the superscript s denotes a quantity belonging to the s-th example.",

        "51": "\u2207\u03b8a log p(j1:i|hi; \u03b8a) can be computed by standard backpropagation.", 
        "52": "Although the above estimation of \u2207\u03b8aJ2(\u03b8a) is unbiased, it may have very high variance.", 
        "53": "One widely used remedy to reduce the variance is to subtract a baseline value bsi from the reward R\ns, such that the approximated gradient becomes\n\u2207\u03b8aJ2(\u03b8a) \u2248 1\nS\nS\u2211\ns=1\nN\u2211\ni=1\n[\u2207\u03b8a log p(js1:i|hsi ; \u03b8)(Rs\u2212bsi )]\nIt is shown (Williams, 1992; Zaremba and Sutskever, 2015) that any number bsi will yield an unbiased estimation.", 
        "54": "Here, we adopt the strategy of Mnih et al.", 
        "55": "(2014) that bsi = wbh s i + cb and the parameter \u03b8b = {wb, cb} is learned by minimizing (Rs\u2212 bsi )2.", 
        "56": "Now the final objective to minimize is\nJ(\u03b8m, \u03b8a, \u03b8b) = J1(\u03b8m)\u2212J2(\u03b8a)+ S\u2211\ns=1\nN\u2211\ni=1\n(Rs\u2212bsi )2,\nwhich is fully differentiable and can be solved by standard backpropagation.", 
        "57": "2.3 Inference  During inference, we can either use sampling or greedy evaluation by selecting the most probable jumping step suggested by the jump softmax and follow that path.", 
        "58": "In the our experiments, we will adopt the sampling scheme.", 
        "59": "3 Experimental Results  In this section, we present our empirical studies to understand the efficiency of the proposed model in reading text.", 
        "60": "The tasks under experimentation are: synthetic number prediction, sentiment analysis, news topic classification and automatic question answering.", 
        "61": "Those, except the first one, are representative tasks in text reading involving different sizes of datasets and various levels of text processing, from character to word and to sentence.", 
        "62": "Table 1 summarizes the statistics of the dataset in our experiments.", 
        "63": "To exclude the potential impact of advanced models, we restrict our comparison between the vanilla LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) and our model, which is referred to as LSTM-Jump.", 
        "64": "In a nutshell, we show that, while achieving the same or even better testing accuracy, our model is up to 6 times and 66 times faster than the baseline LSTM model in real and synthetic\ndatasets, respectively, as we are able to selectively skip a large fraction of text.", 
        "65": "In fact, the proposed model can be readily extended to other recurrent neural networks with sophisticated mechanisms such as attention and/or hierarchical structure to achieve higher accuracy than those presented below.", 
        "66": "However, this is orthogonal to the main focus of this work and would be left as an interesting future work.", 
        "67": "General Experiment Settings We use the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a learning rate of 0.001 in all experiments.", 
        "68": "We also apply gradient clipping to all the trainable variables with the threshold of 1.0.", 
        "69": "The dropout rate between the LSTM layers is 0.2 and the embedding dropout rate is 0.1.", 
        "70": "We repeat the notations N,K,R defined previously in Table 2, so readers can easily refer to when looking at Tables 4,5,6 and 7.", 
        "71": "While K is fixed during both training and testing, we would fix R and N at training but vary their values during test to see the impact of parameter changes.", 
        "72": "Note that N is essentially a constraint which can be relaxed.", 
        "73": "Yet we prefer to enforce this constraint here to let the model learn to read fewer tokens.", 
        "74": "Finally, the reported test time is measured by running one pass of the whole test set instance by instance, and the speedup is over the base LSTM model.", 
        "75": "The code is written with TensorFlow.3  3.1 Number Prediction with a Synthetic Dataset  We first test whether LSTM-Jump is indeed able to learn how to jump if a very clear jumping sig-\n3https://www.tensorflow.org/\nnal is given in the text.",

        "77": "That is, the output is chosen from the input sequence, with index determined by x0 .", 
        "78": "Here are two examples to illustrate the idea:\ninput1 : 4, 5, 1, 7, 6, 2. output1 : 6\ninput2 : 2, 4, 9, 4, 5, 6. output2 : 9\nOne can see that x0 is essentially the oracle jumping signal, i.e.",

        "80": "After reading the first token, a \u201csmart\u201d network should be able to learn from the training examples to jump to the output position, skipping the rest.", 
        "81": "We generate 1 million training and 10,000 validation examples with the rule above, each with sequence length T = 100.", 
        "82": "We also impose 1 \u2264 x0 < T to ensure the index is valid.", 
        "83": "We find that directly training the LSTM-Jump with full sequence is unlikely to converge, therefore, we adopt a curriculum training scheme.", 
        "84": "More specifically, we generate sequences with lengths {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100} and train the model starting from the shortest.", 
        "85": "Whenever the training accuracy reaches a threshold, we shift to longer sequences.", 
        "86": "We also train an LSTM with the same curriculum training scheme.", 
        "87": "The training stops when the validation accuracy is larger than 98%.", 
        "88": "We choose such stopping criterion simply because it is the highest that both models can achieve.4 All the networks are single layered, with hidden size 512, embedding size 32 and batch size 100.", 
        "89": "During testing, we generate sequences of lengths 10, 100 and 1000 with the same rule, each having 10,000 examples.", 
        "90": "As the training size is large enough, we do not have to worry about overfitting so dropout is not applied.", 
        "91": "In fact, we find that the training, validation and testing accuracies are almost the same.", 
        "92": "4In fact, our model can get higher but we stick to 98% for ease of comparison.", 
        "93": "The results of LSTM and our method, LSTMJump, are shown in Table 3.", 
        "94": "The first observation is that LSTM-Jump is faster than LSTM; the longer the sequence is, the more significant speedup LSTM-Jump can gain.", 
        "95": "This is because the well-trained LSTM-Jump is aware of the jumping signal at the first token and hence can directly jump to the output position to make prediction, while LSTM is agnostic to the signal and has to read the whole sequence.", 
        "96": "As a result, the reading speed of LSTM-Jump is hardly affected by the length of sequence, but that of LSTM is linear with respect to length.", 
        "97": "Besides, LSTM-Jump also outperforms LSTM in terms of test accuracy under all cases.", 
        "98": "This is not surprising either, as LSTM has to read a large amount of tokens that are potentially not helpful and could interfere with the prediction.", 
        "99": "In summary, the results indicate LSTM-Jump is able to learn to jump if the signal is clear.", 
        "100": "3.2 Word Level Sentiment Analysis with Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB datasets  As LSTM-Jump has shown great speedups in the synthetic dataset, we would like to understand whether it could carry this benefit to real-world data, where \u201cjumping\u201d signal is not explicit.",

        "237": "4 Related Work  Closely related to our work is the idea of learning visual attention with neural networks (Mnih et al., 2014; Ba et al., 2014; Sermanet et al., 2014), where a recurrent model is used to combine visual evidence at multiple fixations processed by a convolutional neural network.", 
        "238": "Similar to our approach, the model is trained end-to-end using the REINFORCE algorithm (Williams, 1992).", 
        "239": "However, a major difference between those work and ours is that we have to sample from discrete jumping distribution, while they can sample from continuous distribution such as Gaussian.", 
        "240": "The difference is mainly due to the inborn characteristics of text and image.", 
        "241": "In fact, as pointed out by Mnih et al.", 
        "242": "(2014), it was difficult to learn policies over more than 25 possible discrete locations.", 
        "243": "This idea has recently been explored in the context of natural language processing applications, where the main goal is to filter irrelevant content using a small network (Choi et al., 2016).", 
        "244": "Perhaps the most closely related to our work is the concurrent work on learning to reason with reinforcement\nlearning (Shen et al., 2016).", 
        "245": "The key difference between our work and Shen et al.", 
        "246": "(2016) is that they focus on early stopping after multiple pass of data to ensure accuracy whereas our method focuses on selective reading with single pass to enable fast processing.", 
        "247": "The concept of \u201chard\u201d attention has also been used successfully in the context of making neural network predictions more interpretable (Lei et al., 2016).", 
        "248": "The key difference between our work and Lei et al.", 
        "249": "(2016)\u2019s method is that our method optimizes for faster inference, and is more dynamic in its jumping.", 
        "250": "Likewise is the difference between our approach and the \u201csoft\u201d attention approach by (Bahdanau et al., 2014).", 
        "251": "Our method belongs to adaptive computation of neural networks, whose idea is recently explored by (Graves, 2016; Jernite et al., 2016), where different amount of computations are allocated dynamically per time step.", 
        "252": "The main difference between our method and Graves; Jernite et al.\u2019s methods is that our method can set the amount of computation to be exactly zero for many steps, thereby achieving faster scanning over texts.", 
        "253": "Even though our method requires policy gradient methods to train, which is a disadvantage compared to (Graves, 2016; Jernite et al., 2016), we do not find training with policy gradient methods problematic in our experiments.", 
        "254": "At the high-level, our model can be viewed as a simplified trainable Turing machine, where the controller can move on the input tape.", 
        "255": "It is therefore related to the prior work on Neural Turing Machines (Graves et al., 2014) and especially its RL version (Zaremba and Sutskever, 2015).", 
        "256": "Compared to (Zaremba and Sutskever, 2015), the output tape in our method is more simple and reward signals in our problems are less sparse, which explains why our model is easy to train.", 
        "257": "It is worth noting that Zaremba and Sutskever report difficulty in using policy gradients to train their model.", 
        "258": "Our method, by skipping irrelevant content, shortens the length of recurrent networks, thereby addressing the vanishing or exploding gradients in them (Hochreiter et al., 2001).", 
        "259": "The baseline method itself, Long Short Term Memory (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), belongs to the same category of methods.", 
        "260": "In this category, there are several recent methods that try to achieve the same goal, such as having recurrent networks that operate in different frequency (Koutnik et al., 2014) or\nis organized in a hierarchical fashion (Chan et al., 2015; Chung et al., 2016).", 
        "261": "Lastly, we should point out that we are among the recent efforts that deploy reinforcement learning to the field of natural language processing, some of which have achieved encouraging results in the realm of such as neural symbolic machine (Liang et al., 2017), machine reasoning (Shen et al., 2016) and sequence generation (Ranzato et al., 2015).", 
        "262": "5 Conclusions  In this paper, we focus on learning how to skim text for fast reading.", 
        "263": "In particular, we propose a \u201cjumping\u201d model that after reading every few tokens, it decides how many tokens should be skipped by sampling from a softmax.", 
        "264": "Such jumping behavior is modeled as a discrete decision making process, which can be trained by reinforcement learning algorithm such as REINFORCE.", 
        "265": "In four different tasks with six datasets (one synthetic and five real), we test the efficiency of the proposed method on various levels of text jumping, from character to word and then to sentence.", 
        "266": "The results indicate our model is several times faster than, while the accuracy is on par with the baseline LSTM model.", 
        "267": "Acknowledgments  The authors would like to thank the Google Brain Team, especially Zhifeng Chen and Yuan Yu for helpful discussion about the implementation of this model on Tensorflow.", 
        "268": "The first author also wants to thank Chen Liang, Hanxiao Liu, Yingtao Tian, Fish Tung, Chiyuan Zhang and Yu Zhang for their help during the project.", 
        "269": "Finally, the authors appreciate the invaluable feedback from anonymous reviewers."

        "25": "VQA (Antol et al., 2015; Zitnick and Parikh, 2013) includes crowdsourced questions and answers for photographs and abstract scenes, and has been studied extensively (e.g., Lu et al., 2016; Xu and Saenko, 2016; Zhou et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2015a; Andreas et al., 2016b,a; Ray et al., 2016).", 
        "26": "In contrast to VQA, we use synthetic images and emphasize representing a broad range of language phenomena.", 
        "27": "Our motivation is similar to that of SHAPES (Andreas et al., 2016b) and CLEVR (Johnson et al., 2016).", 
        "28": "Both datasets also use synthetic images and emphasize representing diverse spatial language.", 
        "29": "However, unlike our approach, they include only automatically generated language.", 
        "30": "Visual reasoning has also been addressed in instructional language corpora (e.g., MacMahon et al., 2006; Chen and Mooney, 2011; Bisk et al., 2016), where executable instructions are grounded in manipulable environments.", 
        "31": "The language we observe is similar to the type of language studied for understanding and generation of referential expressions (Mitchell et al., 2010; Matuszek et al., 2012; FitzGerald et al., 2013).", 
        "32": "Our task is related to caption generation, which has been studied extensively (e.g., Pedersoli et al., 2016; Carrara et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016) with MSCOCO (Chen et al., 2015b) and Flickr30K (Young et al., 2014; Plummer et al., 2015).", 
        "33": "In contrast to caption generation, our task does not require approximate metrics like BLEU.", 
        "34": "Several existing datasets focus on natural language querying of structured representations, including GeoQuery (Zelle, 1995) and WikiTables (Pasupat and Liang, 2015).", 
        "35": "Our work is complementary to these resources.", 
        "36": "While our corpus was collected using images, we also provide structured representations.", 
        "37": "When used with these representations, our corpus is similar to WikiTables, where questions are paired with small web tables.", 
        "38": "Instead of web tables, we use object sets and focus on visual language.", 
        "39": "3 Task  Statements in our data are grounded in synthetic images rendered from structured representations.", 
        "40": "Given an example, the task is to determine whether a statement is true or false for the image or structured representation.", 
        "41": "While we describe the image, the structured representation is equivalent.", 
        "42": "We provide examples of the structured representation in the supplementary material.", 
        "43": "Images are divided into three boxes.", 
        "44": "Figure 1 shows two images.", 
        "45": "Each box contains 1-8 objects.", 
        "46": "Each object has four properties: position (x/y coordinates), color (black, blue, yellow), shape (triangle, square, circle), and size (small, medium, large).",

        "50": "This design encourages compositional language with complex visual reasoning.", 
        "51": "We divide the image into boxes to encourage set theoretic reasoning within and between boxes.", 
        "52": "We also use a relatively limited number of values for each property.", 
        "53": "While a large number of properties provides a more diverse image, it is likely to result in descriptions that refer to property differences.", 
        "54": "We find that the limited number of properties elicits descriptions with rich compositional structure.", 
        "55": "4 Data Collection  We generate images following the structure described in Section 3, and collect grounded natural language descriptions.", 
        "56": "Data is collected in two phases: sentence writing and validation.",

        "63": "We generate an equal number of scatter and tower images.", 
        "64": "To generate the sets of images presented to annotators, we generate two images independently, a third image by using the set of objects in the first im-\nage and randomly re-shuffling them between the boxes, and a fourth image by re-shuffling the objects in the second image.", 
        "65": "For images with towers, we constrain the re-shuffling to form towers.", 
        "66": "Phase 1 \u2013 Sentence Writing Each writing task presents an annotator with four images.", 
        "67": "Figure 2 shows the sentence writing prompt, including the set of constraints, which is shown for all writing tasks.", 
        "68": "The constraints force the worker to contrast two pairs by referring to similarities and differences between the images, but not to refer to the position of the image in the prompt, or of each box in each image.", 
        "69": "These constraints are placed to elicit more set-theoretic language, and to allow us to divide the result of each task into four examples, pairing the annotator\u2019s sentence with each of the four images it was presented with.", 
        "70": "Phase 2 \u2013 Validation In the second phase, we pair each sentence with the four images used to generate it.", 
        "71": "We re-label all sentence-image pairs as true or false, correcting for any violations of the constraints in the first phase.", 
        "72": "We do not use the original position of the image as any part of the final label to neutralize any ordering effect.", 
        "73": "In practice, 8.2% of examples had a different label than inferred from their original position in\nthe first phase.", 
        "74": "During validation, boxes are randomly permuted to ensure the last constraint was followed.", 
        "75": "We allow workers to annotate a sentence as nonsensical with regard to the image, and instruct annotators to ignore grammar errors.", 
        "76": "Post-processing We prune pairs when their majority class is nonsensical.", 
        "77": "When collecting multiple annotations for a pair, we prune pairs if the gap between the classes is less than two votes.", 
        "78": "5 Data Statistics and Analysis  We use the crowdsourcing platform Upwork,1 and select ten annotators using a small set of example questions.", 
        "79": "We collect 3,974 task instances and 28,723 total validation judgments at a total cost of $5,526.", 
        "80": "From these 3,974 task instances we extract 15,896 sentence-image pairs.", 
        "81": "We prune 522 pairs in post-processing.", 
        "82": "For the training set we collect a single validation annotation for each sentence-image pair; for the rest of the data we collect five annotations each.", 
        "83": "Finally, we generate six sentence-image pairs from each sample by permuting the boxes.", 
        "84": "The validation step ensures this permutation does not change the label.", 
        "85": "Table 1 shows the number of sentences and pairs, including permutations, for each split.", 
        "86": "We merge the development and test splits to calculate agreement statistics.", 
        "87": "We calculate Krippendorf\u2019s \u03b1 and Fleiss\u2019 \u03ba (Cocos et al., 2015) on both the full and pruned datasets.", 
        "88": "To calculate Fleiss\u2019 \u03ba, we randomly permute the five annotations to be assigned to five \u201craters\u201d and compute average kappa from 100 iterations.", 
        "89": "Before pruning, we observe \u03b1 = 0.768 and \u03ba = 0.709, indicating substantial agreement (Landis and Koch, 1977).", 
        "90": "Pruning improves agreement to \u03b1 = 0.831 (indicating almost-perfect agreement) and \u03ba = 0.808.", 
        "91": "We analyze 200 development sentences to identify the distribution of semantic phenomena and syntactic ambiguity (Table 2).", 
        "92": "For comparison, we apply this analysis to 200 abstract-image and 200 real-image sentences from VQA (Antol et al., 2015).",

        "96": "Our sentences are generally longer than VQA and more similar in length to MSCOCO.", 
        "97": "However, our task is more similar to VQA, where context is used to understand language, rather than to generate.", 
        "98": "6 Methods  We evaluate multiple methods on the rendered images and structured representations.", 
        "99": "Hyperparameters and initialization details are described in the supplementary material.", 
        "100": "2We say a statement or question uses presupposition when it assumes the truth value of some proposition in order for its entire truth value to be defined.", 
        "101": "In this example, an image which does not have three black items will have no defined truth value for this statement.", 
        "102": "6.1 Majority Class and Single Modality  We use image- and text-only models to measure how well biases in our data can be used to solve the task.", 
        "103": "If the model is able to do well on the text- or image-only baselines, this implies our data does not require the two modalities.", 
        "104": "Antol et al.", 
        "105": "(2015) performed a similar analysis of VQA with the questions only to gauge how and if background knowledge of the domain could aid performance.",

        "109": "The CNN output is used by a three-layer perceptron with a softmax on the final layer.3  6.2 Structured Representation  We use the structured representations described in Sections 3 and 4.", 
        "110": "3We also experimented using the ImageNet-trained Inception v4 model (Szegedy et al., 2017), but found it did not improve performance, possibly due to the difference between our images and ImageNet.",

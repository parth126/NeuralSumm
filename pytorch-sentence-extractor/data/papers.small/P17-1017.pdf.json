        "167": "e.g., Wen et al.",

        "171": "From a learning perspective, this means that the RNNLG dataset facilitates learning but also makes it harder to assess how well systems trained on it can generalise to handle unseen input.", 
        "172": "Input shape.", 
        "173": "As mentioned in Section 3, in the RNNLG dataset, all inputs can be viewed as trees of depth one while in the WEBNLG dataset, input may have various shapes.", 
        "174": "As a result, RNNLG texts will be restricted to syntactic forms which permit expressing such multiple predications of the same entity e.g., subject relative clause, VP and sentence coordination etc.", 
        "175": "In contrast, the trees extracted by the WEBNLG content selection procedure may be of depth five and therefore allow for further syntactic constructs such as object relative clause and passive participles (cf.", 
        "176": "Figure 1).", 
        "177": "We can show this empirically as well that WEBNLG is far more diverse than RNNLG in terms of input shapes.", 
        "178": "The RNNLG dataset has only 6 distinct shapes and all of them are of depth 1, i.e., all (attribute, value) pairs in an input are siblings to each other.", 
        "179": "In contrast, the WEBNLG dataset has 58 distinct shapes, out of which only 7 shapes are with depth 1, all others have depth more than 1 and they cover 49.6% of all inputs.",

        "185": "As illustrated by the contrast between Examples (6) and (7) above, text length (number of tokens per text) and the number of sentences per text are strong indicators of the complexity of the generation task.",

        "188": "As shown in Table 4, WEBNLG\u2019s texts are longer both in terms of tokens and in terms of number of sentences per text.", 
        "189": "Another difference between the two datasets is that WEBNLG contains a higher number of text per input thereby providing a better basis for learning paraphrases.", 
        "190": "The size and the content of the vocabulary is another important factor in ensuring the learning of wide coverage generators.", 
        "191": "While a large vocabulary makes the learning problem harder, it also allows for larger coverage.", 
        "192": "WEBNLG exhibits a higher corrected type-token ratio (CTTR), which indicates greater lexical variety, and higher lexical sophistication (LS).", 
        "193": "Lexical sophistication measures the proportion of relatively unusual or advanced word types in the text.", 
        "194": "In practice, LS is the proportion of lexical word types (lemma) which are not in the list of 2,000 most frequent words generated from the British National Corpus11.", 
        "195": "Type-token ratio (TTR) is a measure of diversity defined as the ratio of the number of word types to the number of words in a text.",

        "203": "We use the multi-layered sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism described in (Vinyals et al., 2015).12 The model was trained with 3-layer LSTMs with 512 units each with a batch size of 64 and a learning rate of 0.5.", 
        "204": "To allow for a fair comparison, we use a similar amount of data (13K data-text pairs) for both datasets.", 
        "205": "As RNNLG is bigger in size than WEBNLG, we constructed a balanced sample of RNNLG which included equal number of instances per category (tv, laptop, etc).",

        "207": "The training was done in two delexicalisation modes: fully and name only.", 
        "208": "In case of fully delexicalisation, all entities were replaced by their generic terms, whereas in name only mode only subjects were modified in that way.",

        "210": "The delexicalisation in sentences was done using the exact match between entities and tokens.",

        "212": "Input and output vocabulary sizes are reported in Table 5.", 
        "213": "Table 5 shows the perplexity results.",

        "221": "Similary, the BLEU score of the generated sentences (Papineni et al., 2002) is lower for WEBNLG suggesting again a dataset that is more complex and therefore more difficult to learn from.",

        "223": "One feature of our framework is that datasets created using this framework can be used for training and testing KB verbalisers an in particular, verbalisers for RDF knowledge bases.", 
        "224": "Following the development of the semantic web, many large scale datasets are encoded in the RDF language (e.g., MusicBrainz, FOAF, LinkedGeoData) and official institutions13 increasingly publish their data in this format.", 
        "225": "In this context, our framework is useful both for creating training data from RDF KB verbalisers and to increase the number of datasets available for training and testing NLG.", 
        "226": "Another important feature of our framework is that it permits creating semantically and linguistically diverse datasets which should support the learning of lexically and syntactically, wide coverage micro-planners.", 
        "227": "We applied our framework to DBpedia data and showed that although twice smaller than the largest corpora currently available for training data-to-text microplanners, the resulting dataset is more semantically and linguistically diverse.", 
        "228": "Despite the disparity in size, the number of attributes is comparable in the two datasets.", 
        "229": "The ratio between input and input patterns is five times lower in our dataset thereby making learning harder but also diminishing the risk of overfitting and providing for wider linguistic coverage.", 
        "230": "Conversely, the ratio of text per input is twice higher thereby providing better support for learning paraphrases.",

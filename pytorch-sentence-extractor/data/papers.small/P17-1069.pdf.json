        "2": "In recent U.S. presidential elections, Twitter was widely used by all candidates to promote their agenda, interact with supporters, and attack their opponents.", 
        "3": "Social interactions on such platforms allow politicians to quickly react to current events and gauge interest in and support for their actions.", 
        "4": "These dynamic settings emphasize the importance of constructing automated tools for analyzing this content.", 
        "5": "However, these same dynamics make constructing such tools difficult, as the language used to discuss new events and political agendas continuously changes.", 
        "6": "Consequently, the rich social interactions on Twitter can be leveraged to help support such analysis by providing alternatives to direct supervision.", 
        "7": "In this paper we focus on political framing, a very nuanced political discourse analysis task, on\na variety of issues frequently discussed on Twitter.", 
        "8": "Framing (Entman, 1993; Chong and Druckman, 2007) is employed by politicians to bias the discussion towards their stance by emphasizing specific aspects of the issue.", 
        "9": "For example, the debate around increasing the minimum wage can be framed as a quality of life issue or as an economic issue.", 
        "10": "While the first frame supports increasing minimum wage because it improves workers\u2019 lives, the second frame, by conversely emphasizing the costs involved, opposes the increase.", 
        "11": "Using framing to analyze political discourse has gathered significant interest over the last few years (Tsur et al., 2015; Card et al., 2015; Baumer et al., 2015) as a way to automatically analyze political discourse in congressional speeches and political news articles.",

        "18": "We approach this framing prediction task using a weakly supervised collective classification approach which leverages the dependencies between tweet frame predictions based on the interactions between their authors.", 
        "19": "These dependencies are modeled by connecting Twitter users who have social connections or behavioral similarities.", 
        "20": "Social connections are di-\n741\nrected dependencies that represent the followers of each user as well as retweeting behavior (i.e., user A retweets user B\u2019s content).", 
        "21": "Interestingly, such social connections capture the flow of influence within political parties; however, the number of connections that cross party lines is extremely low.", 
        "22": "Instead, we rely on capturing behavioral similarity between users to provide this information.", 
        "23": "For example, users whose Twitter activity peaks at similar times tend to discuss issues in similar ways, providing indicators of their frame usage for those issues.", 
        "24": "In addition to using social and behavioral information, our approach also incorporates each politician\u2019s party affiliation and the frequent phrases (e.g., bigrams and trigrams) used by politicians on Twitter.", 
        "25": "These lexical, social, and behavioral features are extracted from tweets via weakly supervised models and then declaratively compiled into a graphical model using Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL), a recently introduced probabilistic modeling framework.1 As described in Section 4, PSL specifies high level rules over a relational representation of these features.",

        "143": "This approach decreases the F1 score for a majority of frames.", 
        "144": "Both SVMs also result in F1 scores of 0 for some frames, further lowering the overall performance.", 
        "145": "Finally, columns 4 and 5 show the results of using our worst and best PSL models, respectively.", 
        "146": "PSL Model 1, which uses our adapted unigram features instead of the bag-of-words features for multilabel classification, serves as our baseline to improve upon.",

        "155": "Similarly, Model 5 achieves the highest prediction for 5 of the frames, suggesting network follower information cannot further improve the score for these frames.", 
        "156": "Overall, the Twitter behavior based models are able to outperform language based models alone, including the best performing language model (Model 3) which combines unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams together to collectively infer the correct frames.", 
        "157": "Analysis of Unsupervised Experiments: In the unsupervised setting, Model 6, the combination of language and Twitter behavior features achieves the best results on 16 of the 17 issues, as shown in Table 6.", 
        "158": "There are a few interesting aspects of the unsupervised setting which differ from the supervised setting.", 
        "159": "Six of the frame predictions do worse in Model 2, which is double that of the supervised version.", 
        "160": "This is likely due to the presence of overlapping bigrams across frames and issues, e.g., \u201cwomen\u2019s healthcare\u201d could appear in both Frames 4 and 8 and the issues of ACA and abortion.", 
        "161": "However, all six are able to improve with the addition of trigrams (Model 3), whereas only 1 of 3 frames improves in the supervised setting.", 
        "162": "This suggests that bigrams may not be as useful as trigrams in an unsupervised setting.", 
        "163": "Finally, in Model 5, which adds retweet behaviors, we notice that 5 of the frames decrease in F1 score and 11\nof the frames have the same score as the previous model.", 
        "164": "These results suggest that retweet behaviors are not as useful as the follower network relationships in an unsupervised setting.", 
        "165": "6 Qualitative Analysis  To explore the usefulness of frame identification in political discourse analysis, we apply our best performing model (Model 6) on the unlabeled dataset to determine framing patterns over time, both by party and individual.", 
        "166": "Figure 2 shows the results of our frame analysis for both parties over time for two issues: ACA and terrorism.6 We compiled the predicted frames for tweets from 2014 to 2016 for each party.", 
        "167": "Figure 3 presents the results of frame prediction for 2015 tweets of aisle-crossing individual politicians for these two issues.", 
        "168": "Party Frames: From Figure 2(a) we can see that Democrats mainly use Frames 1, 4, 8, 9, and 15 to discuss ACA, while Figure 2(c) shows that Republicans predominantly use Frames 1, 8, 9, 12, and 13.", 
        "169": "Though the parties use similar frames, they are used to express different agendas.", 
        "170": "For example, Democrats use Frame 8 to indicate the positive effect that the ACA has had in granting more Americans health care access.", 
        "171": "Republicans, however, use Frame 8 (and Frame 13) to indicate their party\u2019s agenda to replace the ACA with access to different options for health care.", 
        "172": "Additionally, Democrats use the Fairness & Equality Frame (Frame 4) to convey that the ACA gives minority groups a better chance at accessing health care.", 
        "173": "6Due to space, we omit the other 4 issues.", 
        "174": "These 2 were chosen because they are among the most frequently discussed issues in our dataset.", 
        "175": "They also use Frame 15 to express statistics about enrollment of Americans under the ACA.", 
        "176": "Finally, Republicans use Frames 12 and 13 to bring attention to their own party\u2019s actions to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the ACA with different policies.", 
        "177": "Figures 2(b) and 2(d) show the party-based framing patterns over time for terrorism related tweets.", 
        "178": "For this issue both parties use similar frames: 3, 7, 10, 14, 16, and 17, but to express different views.", 
        "179": "For example, Democrats use Frame 3 to indicate a moral responsibility to fight ISIS.", 
        "180": "Republicans use Frame 3 to frame terrorists or their attacks as a result of \u201cradical Islam\u201d.", 
        "181": "An interesting pattern to note is seen in Frames 10 and 14 for both parties.", 
        "182": "In 2015 there is a large in-\ncrease in the usage of this frame.", 
        "183": "This seems to indicate that parties possibly adopt new frames simultaneously or in response to the opposing party, perhaps in an effort to be in control of the way the message is delivered through that frame.", 
        "184": "Individual Frames: In addition to entire party analysis, we were interested in seeing if frames could shed light on the behavior of aisle-crossing politicians.", 
        "185": "These are politicians who do not vote the same as the majority vote of their party (i.e., they vote the same as the opposing party).", 
        "186": "Identifying such politicians can be useful in governments which are heavily split by party, i.e., governments such as the recent U.S. Congress (2015 to 2017), where politicians tend to vote the same\nas the rest of their party members.", 
        "187": "For this analysis, we collected five 2015 votes from the House of Representatives on both issues and compiled a list of the politicians who voted opposite to their party.", 
        "188": "The most important descriptor we noticed was that all aisle-crossing politicians tweet less frequently on the issue than their fellow party members.", 
        "189": "This is true for both parties.", 
        "190": "This behavior could indicate lack of desire to draw attention to one\u2019s stance on the particular issue.", 
        "191": "Figure 3(a) shows the framing patterns of aislecrossing Republicans on ACA votes from 2015.", 
        "192": "Recall from Figure 2 that Democrats mostly use Frames 1, 4, 8, 9, and 15, while Republicans mainly use Frames 1, 8, and 9.", 
        "193": "In this example, these Republicans are considered aislecrossing votes because they have voted the same as Democrats on this issue.", 
        "194": "The most interesting pattern to note here is that these Republicans use the same framing patterns as the Republicans (Frames 1, 8, and 9), but they also use the frames that are unique to Democrats: Frames 4 and 15.", 
        "195": "These latter two frames appear significantly less in the Republican tweets of our entire dataset as well.", 
        "196": "These results suggest that to predict aisle-crossing\nRepublicans it would be useful to check for usage of typically Democrat-associated frames, especially if those frames are infrequently used by Republicans.", 
        "197": "Figure 3(b) shows the predicted frames for aisle-crossing Democrats on terrorism-related votes.", 
        "198": "We see here that there are very few tweets from these Democrats on this issue and that overall they use the same framing patterns as seen previously: Frames 3, 7, 10, 14, 16, and 17.", 
        "199": "However, given the small scale of these tweets, we can also consider Frames 12 and 13 to show peaks for this example.", 
        "200": "This suggests that for aisle-crossing Democrats the use of additional frames not often used by their party for discussing an issue might indicate potentially different voting behaviors.", 
        "201": "7 Conclusion  In this paper we present the task of collective classification of Twitter data for framing prediction.", 
        "202": "We show that by incorporating Twitter behaviors such as similar activity times and similar networks, we can increase F1 score prediction.", 
        "203": "We provide an analysis of our approach in both supervised and unsupervised settings, as well as a real world analysis of framing patterns over time.", 
        "204": "Finally, our global PSL models can be applied to other domains, such as politics in other countries, simply by changing the initial unigram keywords to reflect the politics of those countries.", 
        "205": "Acknowledgments  We thank the anonymous reviewers for their thoughtful comments and suggestions.", 
        "206": "A Supplementary Material  In this section we provide additional information about our congressional tweets dataset, as well as the lists of keywords and phrases used to filter tweets by issue and the unigrams used to extract information used for the Unigram and MaxSim PSL predicates.", 
        "207": "It is important to note that during preprocessing capitalization, stop words, URLs, and punctuation have been removed from tweets in our dataset.", 
        "208": "Additional word lists along with our PSL scripts and dataset are available at: http://purduenlp.cs.purdue.edu/ projects/twitterframing.", 
        "209": "Dataset Statistics: Figure 4 shows the coverage of the labeled frames by party.", 
        "210": "From this, general patterns can be observed.", 
        "211": "For example, Republicans use Frames 12 and 17 more frequently than Democrats, while Democrats tend to use Frames 4, 9, 10, and 11.", 
        "212": "Table 7 shows the count of each type of frame that appears in each issue in our labeled dataset.",

        "7": "DCPs have been shown to solve a variety of coordination problems, including reference games (Lazaridou et al., 2016b), logic puzzles (Foerster et al., 2016), and simple control (Sukhbaatar et al., 2016).",

        "14": "But a number of successful communication strategies are possible\u2014for example, they might report their exact (x, y) coordinates at every timestep, or they might simply announce whenever they are entering and leaving the intersection.", 
        "15": "If these messages were communicated in natural language, it would be straightforward to determine which strategy was being employed.", 
        "16": "However, DCP agents instead communicate with an automatically induced protocol of unstructured, real-valued recurrent state vectors\u2014an artificial language we might call \u201cneuralese,\u201d which superficially bears little resemblance to natural language, and thus frustrates attempts at direct interpretation.",

        "148": "Suppose further that the messages employed by these human strategies are disjoint; that is, if phi(z |xa) > 0, then phj (z |xa) = 0 for all j 6= i.", 
        "149": "Now suppose that all q(zr , zh) = 0 for all messages in the support of some phi(z |xa) and > 0 for all j 6= i.", 
        "150": "Then every message zr is translated into a message produced by \u03c0hi , and messages from other strategies are ignored.", 
        "151": "This observation follows immediately from the definition of q(zr, zh), but demonstrates one of the key distinctions between our approach and a conventional machine translation criterion.", 
        "152": "Maximizing p(zh|zr) will produce the natural language message most often produced in contexts where zr is observed, regardless of whether that message is useful or informative.", 
        "153": "By contrast, minimizing q(zh, zr) will find the zh that corresponds most closely to zr even when zh is rarely used.", 
        "154": "The disjointness condition, while seemingly quite strong, in fact arises naturally in many circumstances\u2014for example, players in the driving game reporting their spatial locations in absolute vs. relative coordinates, or speakers in a color reference game (Figure 6) discriminating based on lightness vs. hue.", 
        "155": "It is also possible to relax the above condition to require that strategies be only locally disjoint (i.e.", 
        "156": "with the disjointness condition holding for each fixed xa), in which case overlapping human strategies are allowed, and the recovered robot strategy is a context-weighted mixture of these.", 
        "157": "7 Evaluation    7.1 Tasks  In the remainder of the paper, we evaluate the empirical behavior of our approach to translation.", 
        "158": "Our evaluation considers two kinds of tasks: reference games and navigation games.", 
        "159": "In a reference game (e.g.", 
        "160": "Figure 6a), both players observe a pair of candidate referents.", 
        "161": "A speaker is assigned a target referent; it must communicate this target to a listener, who then performs a choice action corresponding to its belief about the true target.", 
        "162": "In this paper we consider two variants on the reference game: a simple color-naming task, and a more complex task involving natural images of birds.", 
        "163": "For examples of human communication strategies for these tasks, we obtain the XKCD color dataset (McMahan and Stone, 2015; Monroe et al., 2016) and the Caltech Birds dataset (Welinder et al., 2010) with accom-\npanying natural language descriptions (Reed et al., 2016).", 
        "164": "We use standard train / validation / test splits for both of these datasets.", 
        "165": "The final task we consider is the driving task (Figure 6c) first discussed in the introduction.", 
        "166": "In this task, two cars, invisible to each other, must each navigate between randomly assigned start and goal positions without colliding.", 
        "167": "This task takes a number of steps to complete, and potentially involves a much broader range of communication strategies.", 
        "168": "To obtain human annotations for this task, we recorded both actions and messages generated by pairs of human Amazon Mechanical Turk workers playing the driving game with each other.", 
        "169": "We collected close to 400 games, with a total of more than 2000 messages exchanged, from which we held out 100 game traces as a test set.", 
        "170": "7.2 Metrics  A mechanism for understanding the behavior of a learned model should allow a human user both to correctly infer its beliefs and to successfully interoperate with it; we accordingly report results of both \u201cbelief\u201d and \u201cbehavior\u201d evaluations.", 
        "171": "To support easy reproduction and comparison (and in keeping with standard practice in machine\ntranslation), we focus on developing automatic measures of system performance.", 
        "172": "We use the available training data to develop simulated models of human decisions; by first showing that these models track well with human judgments, we can be confident that their use in evaluations will correlate with human understanding.", 
        "173": "We employ the following two metrics:\nBelief evaluation This evaluation focuses on the denotational perspective in semantics that motivated the initial development of our model.", 
        "174": "We have successfully understood the semantics of a message zr if, after translating zr 7\u2192 zh, a human listener can form a correct belief about the state in which zr was produced.", 
        "175": "We construct a simple state-guessing game where the listener is presented with a translated message and two state observations, and must guess which state the speaker was in when the message was emitted.", 
        "176": "When translating from natural language to neuralese, we use the learned agent model to directly guess the hidden state.", 
        "177": "For neuralese to natural language we must first construct a \u201cmodel human listener\u201d to map from strings back to state representations; we do this by using the training data to fit a simple regression model that scores (state, sentence) pairs using a bag-of-words sentence representation.", 
        "178": "We find that our \u201cmodel human\u201d matches the judgments of real humans 83% of the time on the colors task, 77% of the time on the birds task, and 77% of the time on the driving task.", 
        "179": "This gives us confidence that the model human gives a reasonably accurate proxy for human interpretation.", 
        "180": "Behavior evaluation This evaluation focuses on the cooperative aspects of interpretability: we measure the extent to which learned models are able to interoperate with each other by way of a translation layer.", 
        "181": "In the case of reference games, the goal of this semantic evaluation is identical to the goal of the game itself (to identify the hidden state of the speaker), so we perform this additional pragmatic evaluation only for the driving game.", 
        "182": "We found that the most data-efficient and reliable way to make use of human game traces was to construct a \u201cdeaf\u201d model human.", 
        "183": "The evaluation selects a full game trace from a human player, and replays both the human\u2019s actions and messages exactly (disregarding any incoming messages); the evaluation measures the quality of the natural-language-toneuralese translator, and the extent to which the\nlearned agent model can accommodate a (real) human given translations of the human\u2019s messages.", 
        "184": "Baselines We compare our approach to two baselines: a random baseline that chooses a translation of each input uniformly from messages observed during training, and a direct baseline that directly maximizes p(z\u2032|z) (by analogy to a conventional machine translation system).", 
        "185": "This is accomplished by sampling from a DCP speaker in training states labeled with natural language strings.", 
        "186": "8 Results  In all below, \u201cR\u201d indicates a DCP agent, \u201cH\u201d indicates a real human, and \u201cH*\u201d indicates a model human player.", 
        "187": "Reference games Results for the two reference games are shown in Table 1.", 
        "188": "The end-to-end trained model achieves nearly perfect accuracy in both\ncases, while a model trained to communicate in natural language achieves somewhat lower performance.", 
        "189": "Regardless of whether the speaker is a DCP and the listener a model human or vice-versa, translation based on the belief-matching criterion in Section 5 achieves the best performance; indeed, when translating neuralese color names to natural language, the listener is able to achieve a slightly higher score than it is natively.", 
        "190": "This suggests that the automated agent has discovered a more effective strategy than the one demonstrated by humans in the dataset, and that the effectiveness of this strategy is preserved by translation.", 
        "191": "Example translations from the reference games are depicted in Figure 2 and Figure 7.", 
        "192": "Driving game Behavior evaluation of the driving game is shown in Table 3, and belief evaluation is shown in Table 2.", 
        "193": "Translation of messages in the driving game is considerably more challenging than in the reference games, and scores are uniformly lower; however, a clear benefit from the beliefmatching model is still visible.", 
        "194": "Belief matching leads to higher scores on the belief evaluation in both directions, and allows agents to obtain a higher reward on average (though task completion rates remain roughly the same across all agents).", 
        "195": "Some example translations of driving game messages are shown in Figure 8.", 
        "196": "9 Conclusion  We have investigated the problem of interpreting message vectors from deep networks by translating them.", 
        "197": "After introducing a translation criterion based on matching listener beliefs about speaker states, we presented both theoretical and empirical evidence that this criterion outperforms a conventional machine translation approach at recovering the content of message vectors and facilitating collaboration between humans and learned agents.", 
        "198": "While our evaluation has focused on understanding the behavior of deep communicating policies, the framework proposed in this paper could be much more generally applied.", 
        "199": "Any encoder\u2013 decoder model (Sutskever et al., 2014) can be thought of as a kind of communication game played between the encoder and the decoder, so we can analogously imagine computing and translating \u201cbeliefs\u201d induced by the encoding to explain what features of the input are being transmitted.", 
        "200": "The current work has focused on learning a purely categorical model of the translation process, supported by an unstructured inventory of translation candidates, and future work could explore the compositional structure of messages, and attempt to synthesize novel natural language or neuralese messages from scratch.", 
        "201": "More broadly, the work here shows that the denotational perspective from formal semantics provides a framework for precisely framing the demands of interpretable machine learning (Wilson et al., 2016), and particularly for ensuring that human users without prior exposure to a learned model are able to interoperate with it, predict its behavior, and diagnose its errors.",

        "151": "A systematic analysis across 19,000 word pairs (where all models agree on the output) shows that this effect only holds for longer input sequences (\u2265 7 characters), with a mean \u03c1 = 0.303 (\u00b10.177) for attentional vs. MTL model, while the base model correlates with either of them by \u03c1 < 0.21.", 
        "152": "6 Related Work  Many traditional approaches to spelling normalization of historical texts use edit distances or some form of character-level rewrite rules, handcrafted (Baron and Rayson, 2008) or learned automatically (Bollmann, 2013; Porta et al., 2013).", 
        "153": "A more recent approach is based on characterbased statistical machine translation applied to historical text (Pettersson et al., 2013; S\u00e1nchezMart\u00ednez et al., 2013; Scherrer and Erjavec, 2013; Ljube\u0161ic\u0301 et al., 2016) or dialectal data (Scherrer and Ljube\u0161ic\u0301, 2016).", 
        "154": "This is conceptually very similar to our approach, except that we substitute the classical SMT algorithms for neural networks.", 
        "155": "Indeed, our models can be seen as a form of character-based neural MT (Cho et al., 2014).",

        "159": "Bollmann and S\u00f8gaard (2016) also use bi-LSTMs to frame spelling normalization as a characterbased sequence labelling task, performing character alignment as a preprocessing step.", 
        "160": "Multi-task learning was shown to be effective for a variety of NLP tasks, such as POS tagging, chunking, named entity recognition (Collobert et al., 2011) or sentence compression (Klerke et al., 2016).",

        "162": "7 Conclusion and Future Work  We presented an approach to historical spelling normalization using neural networks with an encoder-decoder architecture, and showed that it consistently outperforms several existing baselines.", 
        "163": "Encouragingly, our work proves to be fully competitive with the sequence-labeling approach by Bollmann and S\u00f8gaard (2016), without requiring a prior character alignment.", 
        "164": "Specifically, we demonstrated the aptitude of multi-task learning to mitigate the shortage of training data for the named task.", 
        "165": "We included a multifaceted analysis of the effects that MTL introduces to our models and the resemblance that it bears to attention mechanisms.", 
        "166": "We believe that this analysis is a valuable contribution to the understanding of MTL approaches also beyond spelling normalization, and we are confident that our observations will stimulate further research into the relationship between MTL and attention.", 
        "167": "Finally, many improvements to the presented approach are conceivable, most notably introducing some form of token context to the model.", 
        "168": "Currently, we only consider word forms in isolation, which is problematic for ambiguous cases (such as jn, which can normalize to in \u2018in\u2019 or ihn \u2018him\u2019) and conceivably makes the task harder for others.",

        "172": "Such an approach could also deal with the issue of tokenization differences between the historical and the modern text, which is another challenge often found in datasets of historical text.",

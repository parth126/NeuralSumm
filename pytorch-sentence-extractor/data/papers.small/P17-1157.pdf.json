        "159": "To validate this, we apply 5-fold cross validation, first on all the data (2006\u20132015), and then on smaller sets by dropping the oldest year i.e.", 
        "160": "the next subsets use the reports 2007\u20132015, 2008\u2013 2015 and so forth.", 
        "161": "The results of the r2 measure are shown in Figure 1b.", 
        "162": "We observe that by dropping the oldest years one by one (from left to right in the figure), the performance starts improving.", 
        "163": "We argue that this improvement is due to the reduction of noise in data, noise caused by conceptual drifts in the reports as also mentioned by Dyer et al.", 
        "164": "(2016).", 
        "165": "In fact, although in machine learning in general using more data results in better generalization of the model and therefore better prediction, the reports of the older years introduce noise.", 
        "166": "As shown, the most coherent and largest data consists of the subset of the reports published between 2012 to 2015.", 
        "167": "This subset is also the most recent cluster and presumably more similar to the future reports.", 
        "168": "Therefore, in the following, we only use this subset, which consists of 3892 reports, belonging to 1323 companies.", 
        "169": "6.2 Volatility Prediction  Given the dataset of the 2012\u20132015 reports, we try all combinations of different term weighting schemes using the LexExt keyword set.", 
        "170": "All weighting schemes are then combined with the market features with the introduced fusion methods.", 
        "171": "The prediction is done with 5-fold cross validation.", 
        "172": "The averages of the results of the first four quartiles (first year) are reported in Table 1.", 
        "173": "To make showing the results tractable, we use the best fusion (stacking) for the weighting schemes and the best scheme (B\u0302M25) for fusions.", 
        "174": "Regarding the weighting schemes, B\u0302M25, BM25, and T\u0302C show the best results.", 
        "175": "In general, the extended schemes (with hat) improve upon their normal forms.", 
        "176": "For the feature fusion methods, stacking outperforms the other approaches in both evaluation measures.", 
        "177": "MKL however has better performance than early fusion while it has the highest computational complexity among the methods.", 
        "178": "Based on these results, as our best performing approach in the remainder of the paper, we use B\u0302M25 (with LexExt set), reduced to 400 dimensions and stacking as the fusion method.", 
        "179": "Table 2 summarizes the results of our best per-\nforming method compared with previously existing methods.", 
        "180": "Our method outperforms all state-ofthe-art methods both when using textual features only as well as a combination of textual and market features.", 
        "181": "Let us now take a closer look on the changes in the performance of the prediction in time.", 
        "182": "The results of 5-fold cross validation for both tasks on the dataset of the reports, published between 2012\u20132015 are shown in Figure 2a.", 
        "183": "The X-axes show eight quartiles after the publication date of the report.", 
        "184": "For comparison, the GARCH and only market features are depicted with dashed lines.", 
        "185": "As shown, the performance of the GARCH method as well as that using only market features (Market) decrease faster in the later quartiles since the historical prices used for prediction become less relevant as time goes by.", 
        "186": "Using only text features (Text), we see a roughly similar performance between the first four quartiles (first year), while the performance, in general, slightly decreases in the second year.", 
        "187": "By combining the textual and market features (Text+Market), we see a consistent improvement in comparison to each of them alone.", 
        "188": "In comparison to using only market features, the combination of the features shows more stable results in the later quartiles.", 
        "189": "These results support the informativeness of the 10-K reports to more effectively foreseen volatility in long-term windows.", 
        "190": "While the above experiments are based on cross-validation, for the sake of completeness it is noteworthy to consider the scenarios of realworld applications where the future prediction is based on past data.", 
        "191": "We therefore design three experiments by considering the reports published\nin 2013, 2014, and 2015 as test set and the reports published before each year as training set (only 2012, 2012\u20132013, and 2012\u20132014 respectively).", 
        "192": "The results of predicting the reports of each year together with the cross validation scenario (CV) are shown in Figure 2b.", 
        "193": "While the performance becomes slightly worse in the target years 2013 and 2015, in general the combination of textual and market features can explain approximately half of volatility in the financial system.", 
        "194": "6.3 Sectors  Corporations in the same sector share not only similar products or services but also risks and instability factors.", 
        "195": "Considering the sentiment of the financial system as a homogeneous body may neglect the specific factors of each sector.", 
        "196": "We therefore set out to investigate the existence and nature of these differences.", 
        "197": "We start by observing the prediction performance on different sectors: We use our method from the previous section, but split the test set across sectors and plot the results in Figure 2c.", 
        "198": "The hashed areas indicate the GARCH and Market baselines for the Text and Text+Market feature sets, respectively.", 
        "199": "We observe considerable differences between the performance of the sectors, especially when using only sentiment analysis methods (i.e.", 
        "200": "only text features).", 
        "201": "Given these differences and also the probable similarities between the risk factors of the reports in the same sector, a question immediately arises: can training different models for different sectors improve the performance of prediction?", 
        "202": "To answer it, for each sector, we train a model using only the subset of the reports in that sec-\nen e in d fin te ch m is c ndu\nr ca pt du r se rv pu b hl th\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 r 2\nSector-agnostic Sector-specific General model\n(a) Text\nen e in d fin te ch m is c ndu\nr ca pt du r se rv pu b hl th\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 r 2\nSector-agnostic Sector-specific General model\n(b) Text+Market\nFigure 3: Results when retraining on sector-specific subsets versus the general model and versus subsets of the same size but sector-agnostic.",

        "204": "tor and use 5-fold validation to observe performance.", 
        "205": "We refer to these models as sector-specific in contrast to the general model, trained on all the data.", 
        "206": "Figures 3a and 3b compare their results: we can see that the sector-specific bars are lower than the general model ones.", 
        "207": "This is to some extent surprising, as one would expect that domainspecific training would improve the performance of sentiment analysis in text.", 
        "208": "However, we need to consider the size of the training set.", 
        "209": "By training on each sector we have reduced the size of our training sets to those reported in Table 3.", 
        "210": "To verify the effect of the size of training data, we train a sector-agnostic model for each sector.", 
        "211": "Each sector-agnostic model is trained by random sampling of a training set of the same size as the set available for its sector from all the reports, but evaluated\u2013similar to sector-specific models\u2013on the test set of the sector.", 
        "212": "Figures 3a and 3b also plot the results of the sector-agnostic models.", 
        "213": "The large performance differences between sector-agnostic and -specific show the existence of particular risk factors in each sector and their importance.", 
        "214": "Results also confirm the hypothesis that the data for training in each sector is simply too small, and as additional data is accumulated, we can further improve on the results by training on different sectors independently.", 
        "215": "We continue by examining some examples of essential terms in sectors.", 
        "216": "To address this, we have to train a linear regression method on all the reports of each sector, without using any dimensionality reduction.", 
        "217": "Linear regression without dimensionality reduction has the benefit of interpretability: the coefficient of each feature (i.e.", 
        "218": "term in the lexicon) can be seen as its importance with regards to volatility prediction.", 
        "219": "After training, we observe that some keywords e.g.", 
        "220": "crisis, or delist constantly have high coefficient values in the sector-specific as well as general model.", 
        "221": "However, some keywords are particularly weighted high in specificsector models.", 
        "222": "For instance, the keyword fire has a high coefficient in the energy sector, but very low in the others.", 
        "223": "The reason is due to the problem of ambiguity i.e.", 
        "224": "in the energy sector, fire is widely used to refer to explosion e.g.", 
        "225": "\u2018fire and explosion hazards\u2019 while in the lexicon, it is stemmed from firing and fired: the act of dismissing from a job.", 
        "226": "This later sense of word is however weighted as a low risk-sensitive keyword in the other sectors.", 
        "227": "Such an ambiguity can indeed be mitigated by sectorspecific models since the variety of the words\u2019 senses are more restricted inside each sector.", 
        "228": "Another example is an interesting observation on the word beneficial.", 
        "229": "The word is introduced as a positive sentiment in the lexicon while it gains highly negative sentiments in some sectors (health care, and basic industries).", 
        "230": "Investigating in the reports, we observe the broad use of the expression \u2018beneficial owner\u2019 which is normally followed by riskfull sentences since the beneficial owners can potentially influence shareholders\u2019 decision power.", 
        "231": "7 Conclusion  In this work, we studied the sentiment of recent 10-K annual disclosures of companies in stock markets for forecasting volatility.", 
        "232": "Our bag-ofwords sentiment analysis approach benefits from state-of-the-art models in information retrieval which use word embeddings to extend the weight of the terms to the similar terms in the document.", 
        "233": "Additionally, we explored fusion methods to combine the text features with factual market features, achieved from historical prices i.e.", 
        "234": "GARCH prediction model, and current volatility.", 
        "235": "In both cases, our approach outperforms state-ofthe-art volatility prediction methods with 10-K reports and demonstrates the effectiveness of sentiment analysis in long-term volatility forecasting.", 
        "236": "In addition, we studied the characteristics of each individual sector with regard to risk-sensitive terms.", 
        "237": "Our analysis shows that reports in same sectors considerably share particular risk and instability factors.", 
        "238": "However, despite expectations, training different models on different sectors does not improve performance compared to the general model.", 
        "239": "We traced this to the size of the available data in each sector, and show that there are still benefits in considering sectors, which could be further explored in the future as more data becomes available.",

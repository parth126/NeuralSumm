        "80": "So to deal with the absence of syntactic features, we adopt automatic PoS tagging when training on CSB in this work.", 
        "81": "Some previous techniques, such as finetuning after pretraining (Wang et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016) and multi-task learning (Guo et al., 2016), have\nbeen used to deal with these challenges.", 
        "82": "Though they can also leverage knowledge from different domains, they have following drawbacks: finetuning cannot avoid catastrophic forgetting because learned parameters, whether embeddings or other hidden weights, will be tuned after the model has been initialized; And multi-task learning cannot ignore previously learned harmful features because some features are learned in shared layers, although it avoids forgetting by randomly selecting a task to learn at each iteration.", 
        "83": "Therefore, to solve the above-mentioned challenges, we further introduce progressive learning which we believe is more suitable for the task.",

        "167": "We use Stanford Parser4 for PoS tagging.", 
        "168": "5.2 Results  Performance on Chinese SemBank Table 2 gives the results of Experiment 1.", 
        "169": "We see that precision on CPB with automatic PoS tagging is\n2https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/ 3https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2005T23 4http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml\nabout 0.9 percentage point higher than that on CSB, while recall is about 0.4 percentage point lower, and the gap between F1 scores on CPB and CSB is not significant, which is only about 0.3 percentage point, although the size of CSB is smaller.", 
        "170": "We can explain this by two reasons.", 
        "171": "First, CSB does not have predicate-specific roles which may lead to inconsistency, as we explained in Section 3.", 
        "172": "Thus, it might be easier to learn by machine.", 
        "173": "Second, there are underlying similarities between them: both of them annotate predicateargument structures.", 
        "174": "So when there is sufficient training data, difference between scores on testing sets is not very likely to be huge.", 
        "175": "Overall, the results indicated that the new annotated corpus CSB is not a bad choice for training semantic parser even when this does not involve larger training sets.", 
        "176": "Compare to Methods without Using Heterogeneous Data Table 3 summarizes the SRL performance of previous benchmark methods and our experiments described above.", 
        "177": "Collobert and Weston only conducted their experiments on English corpus, but we notice that their approach has been implemented and tested on CPB by Wang et al.", 
        "178": "(2015), so we also put their result here for comparison.", 
        "179": "We can make several observations from these results.", 
        "180": "Our approach significantly outperforms Sha et al.", 
        "181": "(2016) by a large margin (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, p\n< 0.05), even without using GRA.", 
        "182": "This result can prove the ability of our model to capture underlying similarities between heterogeneous SRL resources.", 
        "183": "Compare to Methods Using Heterogeneous Resources The results of methods using external language resources are also presented in Table 3.", 
        "184": "Not surprisingly, we see that the overall best F1 score, 79.67%, is achieved by the progressive nets with the GRAs.", 
        "185": "Furthermore, as shown in Fig.", 
        "186": "4, PNN with GRA performs better on longer sentences, which is consistent with our expectation.", 
        "187": "Without GRA, the F1 drops 0.37% percentage point to 79.30, confirming that gated recurrent adapter structure is more suitable for our task because it can remember what has been transferred in previous time steps.", 
        "188": "Compared to progressive learning methods, finetuning method does not perform well even with the same network structure (Two-column finetuning), but it is still better than simply pretraining word embeddings (bi-LSTM+CSB embedding).", 
        "189": "This confirms the effectiveness of multicolumn learning structure which add capacity to the model by adding new columns.", 
        "190": "Therefore, as can be seen, our PNN model achieves 79.30% F1 score, outperforming finetuning by 0.88% percentage point, and pretraining embeddings by even larger margin.", 
        "191": "To sum up, not only network structures but also learning methods (finetuning/multitask/progressive) can influence the performance of knowledge transfer.", 
        "192": "According to the results, our PNN approach is more effective than others because it is immune to forgetting and robust to harmful features, and GRA is more suitable for our task than simple adapters.", 
        "193": "6 Related Work    6.1 Chinese Semantic Role Labeling  The concept of Semantic Role Labeling is first proposed by Gildea and Jurafsky(2002).", 
        "194": "Previous work on Chinese SRL mainly focused on how to improve SRL on single corpus.", 
        "195": "Approaches falls into two categories: feature-based machine learning approaches and neural-network-based approaches.", 
        "196": "Using feature-based method, Sun and Jurafsky (2004) did the preliminary work and achieved promising results without using any large\nannotated corpus.", 
        "197": "After CPB was built by Xue and Palmer (2003), more complete and systematic research on Chinese SRL were done (Xue and Palmer, 2005; Chen et al., 2006; Ding and Chang, 2009; Yang et al., 2014).",

        "202": "6.2 Learning with Heterogeneous Data  In this paper, we mainly focus on learning with heterogeneous semantic resource for Chinese SRL.", 
        "203": "Wang et al.", 
        "204": "(2015) introduced heterogeneous data by using pretrained embeddings at initialization and achieved promising results.", 
        "205": "Guo et al.", 
        "206": "(2016) proposed a multitask learning method with a unified neural network model to learn SRL and relation classification task together and also achieved improvement.", 
        "207": "Different from previous work, we proposed a progressive neural network model with gated recurrent adapters to leverage knowledge from heterogeneous semantic data.", 
        "208": "Compared with previous methods, this approach is more constructive, rather than destructive, because it uses lateral connections to access previously learned fea-\ntures which are fixed when learning new tasks.", 
        "209": "And by introducing gated recurrent adapters, we further enhance our model to deal with long sentences and achieve state-of-the-art performance on Chinese PropBank.", 
        "210": "7 Conclusion and Future Work  In this paper, we proposed a progressive neural network model with gated recurrent adapters to leverage heterogeneous corpus for Chinese SRL.", 
        "211": "Unlike previous methods like finetuning, ours leverage prior knowledge via lateral connections.", 
        "212": "Experiments have shown that our model yields better performance on CPB than all baseline models.", 
        "213": "Moreover, we proposed novel gated recurrent adapter to handle transfer on long sentences, The experiment has proved the effectiveness of the new adapter structure.", 
        "214": "We believe that progressive learning with heterogeneous data is a promising avenue to pursue.", 
        "215": "So in the future, we might try to combine more heterogeneous semantic data for other tasks like event extraction and relation classification, etc.", 
        "216": "We also release the new corpus Chinese SemBank for Chinese SRL.",

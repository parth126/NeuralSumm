        "2": "Cognates detection is the task of identifying words across languages that have a common origin.", 
        "3": "Automatic cognates detection is important to linguists because cognates are needed to determine how languages evolved.", 
        "4": "Cognates are used for protolanguage reconstruction (Hall and Klein, 2011; Bouchard-Co\u0302te\u0301 et al., 2013).", 
        "5": "Cognates are important for cross-language dictionary look-up and can also improve the quality of machine translation, word alignment, and bilingual lexicon induction (Simard et al., 1993; Kondrak et al., 2003).", 
        "6": "A word is traditionally only considered cognate with another if both words proceed from the same ancestor.", 
        "7": "Nonetheless, in line with the conventions of previous research in computational lin-\nguistics, we set a broader definition.", 
        "8": "We use the word \u2018cognate\u2019 to denote, as in (Kondrak, 2001): \u201c...words in different languages that are similar in form and meaning, without making a distinction between borrowed and genetically related words; for example, English \u2018sprint\u2019 and the Japanese borrowing \u2018supurinto\u2019 are considered cognate, even though these two languages are unrelated.\u201d These broader criteria are motivated by the ways scientists develop and use cognate identification algorithms in natural language processing (NLP) systems.", 
        "9": "For cross-lingual applications, the advantage of such technology is the ability to identify words for which similarity in meaning can be accurately inferred from similarity in form; it does not matter if the similarity in form is from strict genetic relationship or later borrowing (Mericli and Bloodgood, 2012).", 
        "10": "Cognates detection has received a lot of attention in the literature.", 
        "11": "The research of the use of statistical learning methods to build systems that can automatically perform cognates detection has yielded many interesting and creative approaches for gaining traction on this challenging task.", 
        "12": "Currently, the highest-performing state of the art systems detect cognates based on the combination of multiple sources of information.", 
        "13": "Some of the most indicative sources of information discovered to date are word context information, phonetic information, word frequency information, temporal information in the form of word frequency distributions across parallel time periods, and word burstiness information.", 
        "14": "See section 3 for fuller explanations of each of these sources of information that state of the art systems currently use.",

        "19": "We test if our methods can improve performance by generating new rescored matrices by rescoring all of the pairs of words by taking into account global constraints that apply to cognates detection.",

        "23": "The cognates detection task is an interesting task to apply our methods to for a few reasons:\n\u2022 It\u2019s a challenging unsolved task where ongoing research is frequently reported in the literature trying to improve performance;\n\u2022 There is significant room for improvement in performance;\n\u2022 It has a global structure in its output classifications since if a word lemma1 wi from language L1 is cognate with a word lemma wj from language L2, then wi is not cognate with any other word lemma from L2 different from wj and wj is not cognate with any other word lemma wk from L1.",

        "30": "Although we are not aware of work using global constraints to perform rescoring to improve cognates detection, there are related methodologies for reranking in different settings.", 
        "31": "Methodologically related work includes past work in structured prediction and reranking (Collins, 2002; Collins and Roark, 2004; Collins and Koo, 2005; Taskar et al., 2005a,b).", 
        "32": "Note that in these past works, there are many instances with structured outputs that can be used as training data to learn a structured prediction model.", 
        "33": "For example, a seminal application in the past was using online training with structured perceptrons to learn improved systems for performing various syntactic analyses and tagging of sentences such as POS tagging and base noun phrase chunking (Collins, 2002).", 
        "34": "Note that in those settings the unit at which there are structural constraints is a sentence.", 
        "35": "Also note that there are many sentences available so that online training methods such as discriminative training of structured perceptrons can be used to learn structured predictors effectively in those settings.", 
        "36": "In contrast, for the cognates setting the unit at which there are structural constraints is the entire set of cognates for a language pair and there is only one such unit in existence (for a given language pair).", 
        "37": "We call this a single overarching global structure to make the distinction clear.", 
        "38": "The method we present in this paper deals with a single overarching global structure on the predictions of all instances in the entire problem space for a task.", 
        "39": "For this type of setting, there is only a single global structure in existence, contrasted with the situation of there being many sentences each imposing a global structure on the tagging decisions for that individual sentence.", 
        "40": "Hence, previous structured prediction methods that require numerous instances each having a structured output on which to train parameters via methods such as perceptron training are inapplicable to the cognates setting.", 
        "41": "In this paper we present methods for rescoring effectively in settings with a single overarching global structure and show their applicability to improving the performance of cognates detection.", 
        "42": "Still, we note that philosophically our method builds on previous structured prediction methods since in both cases there is a similar intuition in that we\u2019re\nusing higher-level structural properties to inform and accordingly alter our system\u2019s predictions of values for subitems within a structure.", 
        "43": "In section 2 we present our methods for performing rescoring of matrices based on global constraints such as those that apply for cognates detection.", 
        "44": "The key intuition behind our approach is that the scoring of word pairs for cognateness ought not be made independently as is currently done, but rather that global constraints ought to be taken into account to inform and potentially alter system scores for word pairs based on the scores of other word pairs.", 
        "45": "In section 3 we provide results of experiments testing the proposed methods on the cognates detection task on multiple datasets with multiple language pairs under multiple conditions.", 
        "46": "We show that the new methods complement and effectively improve performance over state of the art performance achieved by combining the major research breakthroughs that have taken place in cognates detection research to date.", 
        "47": "Complete precision-recall curves are provided that show the full range of performance improvements over the current state of the art that are achieved.", 
        "48": "Summary measurements of performance improvements, depending on the language pair and dataset, range from 6.73 absolute MaxF1 percentage points to 16.75 absolute MaxF1 percentage points and from 5.58 absolute 11-point interpolated average precision percentage points to 17.19 absolute 11-point interpolated average precision percentage points.", 
        "49": "Section 4 discusses the results and possible extensions of the method.", 
        "50": "Section 5 wraps up with the main conclusions.", 
        "51": "2 Algorithm  While our focus in this paper is on using global constraints to improve cognates detection, we believe that our method is useful more generally.", 
        "52": "We therefore abstract out some of the specifics of cognates detection and present our algorithm more generally in this section, with the hope that it will be able to be used in the future for other applications in addition to cognates detection.", 
        "53": "None of our abstraction harms understanding of our method\u2019s applicability to cognates detection and the fact that the method may be more widely beneficial does not in any way detract from the utility we show it has for improving cognates detection.", 
        "54": "A common setting is where one has a set X = {x1, x2, ..., xn} and a set Y = {y1, y2, ..., yn}\nwhere the task is to extract (x, y) pairs such that (x, y) are in some relation R. Here are examples:\n\u2022 X might be a set of states and Y might be a set of cities and the relation R might be \u201cis the capital of\u201d;\n\u2022 X might be a set of images and Y might be a set of people\u2019s names and the relation R might be \u201cis a picture of\u201d;\n\u2022 X might be a set of English words and Y might be a set of French words and the relation R might be \u201cis cognate with\u201d.", 
        "55": "A common way these problems are approached is that a model is trained that can score each pair (x, y) and those pairs with scores above a threshold are extracted.", 
        "56": "We propose that often the relation will have a tendency, or a hard constraint, to satisfy particular properties and that this ought to be utilized to improve the quality of the extracted pairs.", 
        "57": "The approach we put forward is to re-score each (x, y) pair by utilizing scores generated for other pairs and our knowledge of properties of the relation being extracted.", 
        "58": "In this paper, we present and evaluate methods for improving the scores of each (x, y) pair for the case when the relation is known to be one-to-one and discuss extensions to other situations.", 
        "59": "The current approach is to generate a matrix of scores for each candidate pair as follows:\nScoreX,Y =   sx1,y1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 sx1,yn ... .",

        "62": "... sxn,y1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 sxn,yn\n  .", 
        "63": "(1)\nThen those pairs with scores above a threshold are predicted as being in the relation.", 
        "64": "We now describe methods for sharpening the scores in the matrix by utilizing the fact that there is an overarching global structure on the predictions.", 
        "65": "2.1 Reverse Rank  We know that if (xi, yj) \u2208 R, then (xk, yj) /\u2208 R for k 6= i when R is 1-to-1.", 
        "66": "We define reverse rank(xi, yj) = |{xk \u2208 X|sxk,yj \u2265 sxi,yj}|.", 
        "67": "Intuitively, a high reverse rank means that there are lots of other elements of X that score better to yj than xi does; this could be evidence that (xi, yj) is not in R and ought to have a lower score.", 
        "68": "Alternatively, if there are very few or no other elements of X that score better to yj than xi does this\ncould be evidence that (xi, yj) is in R and ought to have a higher score.", 
        "69": "In accord with this intuition, we use reverse rank as the basis for rescaling our scores as follows:\nscoreRR(xi, yj) = sxi,yj\nreverse rank(xi, yj) .", 
        "70": "(2)  2.2 Forward Rank  Analogous to reverse rank, another basis we can use for adjusting scores is the forward rank.", 
        "71": "We define forward rank(xi, yj) = |{yk \u2208 Y |sxi,yk \u2265 sxi,yj}|.", 
        "72": "We then scale the scores analogously to how we did with reverse ranks via an inverse linear function.2  2.3 Combining Reverse Rank and Forward Rank  For combining reverse rank and forward rank, we present results of experiments doing it two ways.", 
        "73": "The first is a 1-step approach:\nscoreRR FR 1step(xi, yj) = sxi,yj\nproduct , (3)\nwhere\nproduct =reverse rank(xi, yj)\u00d7 forward rank(xi, yj).", 
        "74": "(4)\nThe second combination method involves first computing the reverse rank and re-adjusting every score based on the reverse ranks.", 
        "75": "Then in a second step the new scores are used to compute forward ranks and then those scores are adjusted based on the forward ranks.", 
        "76": "We refer to this method as RR FR 2step.", 
        "77": "2.4 Maximum Assignment  If one makes the assumption that all elements in X and Y are present and have their partner element in the other set present with no extra elements and the sets are not too large, then it is interesting to compute what the \u2018maximal assignment\u2019 would be using the Hungarian Algorithm to optimize:\nmax Z\u2208X\u00d7Y\n\u2211\n(x,y)\u2208Z score(x, y)\ns.t.",

        "79": "(5) 2For both reverse rank and forward rank we also experimented with exponential decay and step functions, but found that simple division by the ranks worked as well or better than any of those more complicated methods.", 
        "80": "We do this on datasets where the assumptions hold and see how close our methods get to the Hungarian maximal assignment at similar points of the precision-recall curves.", 
        "81": "For our larger datasets where the assumptions don\u2019t hold, the Hungarian either can\u2019t complete due to limited computational resources or it functioned poorly in comparison with the performance of our reverse rank and forward rank combination methods.", 
        "82": "3 Experiments  Our goal is to test whether using the global structure algorithms we described in section 2 can significantly boost performance for cognates detection.", 
        "83": "To test this hypothesis, our first step is to implement a system that uses state of the art research results to generate the initial score matrices as a current state of the art system would currently do for this task.", 
        "84": "To that end, we implemented a baseline state of the art system that uses the information sources that previous research has found to be helpful for this task such as phonetic information, word context information, temporal context information, word frequency information, and word burstiness information (Kondrak, 2001; Mann and Yarowsky, 2001; Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002; Klementiev and Roth, 2006; Irvine and Callison-Burch, 2013).", 
        "85": "Consistent with past work (Irvine and Callison-Burch, 2013), we use supervised training to learn the weights for combining the various information sources.",

        "87": "This baseline system obtains state of the art performance on cognates detection.", 
        "88": "Using this state of the art system as our baseline, we investigated how much we could improve performance beyond current state of the art levels by applying the rescoring algorithm we described in section 2.",

        "153": "Therefore, we run a second set of evaluations where we take the ten thousand most common words in our corpora for each of our languages, which contain many of the cognates from the standard test sets and we add in any remaining words from the standard test sets that didn\u2019t make it into the top ten thousand.", 
        "154": "We then repeat each of the experi-\nments under this much more challenging condition.", 
        "155": "With approx.", 
        "156": "ten thousand squared candidates, i.e., approx.", 
        "157": "100 million candidates, to consider for cognateness, this is a large data condition.", 
        "158": "The Hungarian didn\u2019t run to completion on two of the datasets due to limited computational resources.", 
        "159": "On French-English it completed, but achieved poorer performance than any of the other methods.", 
        "160": "This makes sense as it is designed when there really is a bipartite matching to be found like in the artificial yet standard cognates evaluation that was just presented.", 
        "161": "When confronted with large amounts of words that create a much denser space and have no match at all on the other side the all or nothing assignments of the Hungarian are not ideal.", 
        "162": "The reverse rank and forward rank rescoring methods are still quite effective in improving performance although not by as much as they did in the small data results from above.", 
        "163": "Figure 4 shows the full precision-recall curves for French-English for the large data condition, Figure 5 shows the curves for German-English for the large data condition, and Figure 6 shows the results for Spanish-English for the large data condition.", 
        "164": "Tables 4 through 6 show the summary metrics for the three language pairs for the large data experiments.", 
        "165": "We can see that the reverse rank and forward rank methods of taking into account the global structure of interactions among predictions is still helpful, providing large improvements in performance even in this challenging large data condition over strong state of the art baselines that\nmake cognate predictions independently of each other and don\u2019t do any rescoring based on global constraints.", 
        "166": "4 Discussion  We believe that this work opens up new avenues for further exploration.", 
        "167": "A few of these include the following:\n\u2022 investigating the utility of applying and extending the method to other applications such as Information Extraction applications, many of which have similar global constraints as cognates detection;\n\u2022 investigating how to handle other forms of global structure including tendencies that are\nnot necessarily hard constraints;\n\u2022 developing more theory to more precisely understand some of the nuances of using global structure when it\u2019s applicable and making connections with other areas of machine learning such as semi-supervised learning, active learning, etc.", 
        "168": "; and\n\u2022 investigating how to have a machine learn that global structure exists and learn what form of global structure exists.", 
        "169": "5 Conclusions  Cognates detection is an interesting and challenging task.", 
        "170": "Previous work has yielded state of the art approaches that create a matrix of scores for all word pairs based on optimized weighted combinations of component scores computed on the basis of various helpful sources of information such as phonetic information, word context information, temporal context information, word frequency information, and word burstiness information.", 
        "171": "However, when assigning a score to a word pair, the current state of the art methods do not take into account scores assigned to other word pairs.", 
        "172": "We proposed a method for rescoring the matrix that cur-\nrent state of the art methods produce by taking into account the scores assigned to other word pairs.", 
        "173": "The methods presented in this paper are complementary to existing state of the art methods, easy to implement, computationally efficient, and practically effective in improving performance by large amounts.", 
        "174": "Experimental results reveal that the new methods significantly improve state of the art performance in multiple cognates detection experiments conducted on standard freely and publicly available datasets with different language pairs and various conditions such as different levels of baseline performance and different data size conditions, including with more realistic large data size conditions than have been evaluated with in the past."

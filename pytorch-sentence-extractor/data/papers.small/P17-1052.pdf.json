        "2": "In recent years, neural networks that can make use of word order have been shown to be effective for text categorization.", 
        "3": "While simple and shallow convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (Kim, 2014; John-\nson and Zhang, 2015a) were proposed for this task earlier, more recently, deep and more complex neural networks have also been studied, assuming availability of relatively large amounts of training data (e.g., one million documents).", 
        "4": "Examples are deep character-level CNNs (Zhang et al., 2015; Conneau et al., 2016), a complex combination of CNNs and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) (Tang et al., 2015), and RNNs in a wordsentence hierarchy (Yang et al., 2016).", 
        "5": "A CNN is a feedforward network with convolution layers interleaved with pooling layers.", 
        "6": "Essentially, a convolution layer converts to a vector every small patch of data (either the original data such as text or image or the output of the previous layer) at every location (e.g., 3-word windows around every word), which can be processed in parallel.", 
        "7": "By contrast, an RNN has connections that form a cycle.", 
        "8": "In its typical application to text, a recurrent unit takes words one by one as well as its own output on the previous word, which is parallel-processing unfriendly.", 
        "9": "While both CNNs and RNNs can take advantage of word order, the simple nature and parallel-processing friendliness of CNNs make them attractive particularly when large training data causes computational challenges.", 
        "10": "There have been several recent studies of CNN for text categorization in the large training data setting.", 
        "11": "For example, in (Conneau et al., 2016), very deep 32-layer character-level CNNs were shown to outperform deep 9-layer character-level CNNs of (Zhang et al., 2015).", 
        "12": "However, in (Johnson and Zhang, 2016), very shallow 1-layer word-level CNNs were shown to be more accurate and much faster than the very deep characterlevel CNNs of (Conneau et al., 2016).", 
        "13": "Although character-level approaches have merit in not having to deal with millions of distinct words, shallow word-level CNNs turned out to be superior even\n562\nwhen used with only a manageable number (30K) of the most frequent words.", 
        "14": "This demonstrates the basic fact \u2013 knowledge of word leads to a powerful representation.", 
        "15": "These results motivate us to pursue an effective and efficient design of deep wordlevel CNNs for text categorization.", 
        "16": "Note, however, that it is not as simple as merely replacing characters with words in character-level CNNs; doing so rather degraded accuracy in (Zhang et al., 2015).", 
        "17": "We carefully studied deepening of word-level CNNs in the large-data setting and found a deep but low-complexity network architecture with which the best accuracy can be obtained by increasing the depth but not the order of computation time \u2013 the total computation time is bounded by a constant.", 
        "18": "We call it deep pyramid CNN (DPCNN), as the computation time per layer decreases exponentially in a \u2018pyramid shape\u2019.", 
        "19": "After converting discrete text to continuous representation, the DPCNN architecture simply alternates a convolution block and a downsampling layer over and over1, leading to a deep network in which internal data size (as well as per-layer computation) shrinks in a pyramid shape.", 
        "20": "The network depth can be treated as a meta-parameter.", 
        "21": "The computational complexity of this network is bounded to be no more than twice that of one convolution block.", 
        "22": "At the same time, as described later, the \u2018pyramid\u2019 enables efficient discovery of long-range associations in the text (and so more global information), as the network is deepened.", 
        "23": "This is why DPCNN can achieve better accuracy than the shallow CNN mentioned above (hereafter ShallowCNN), which can use only short-range associations.", 
        "24": "Moreover, DPCNN can be regarded as a deep extension of ShallowCNN, which we proposed in (Johnson and Zhang, 2015b) and later tested with large datasets in (Johnson and Zhang, 2016).",

        "38": "2.1 Network architecture  Downsampling with the number of feature maps fixed After each convolution block, we perform max-pooling with size 3 and stride 2.", 
        "39": "That is, the pooling layer produces a new internal representation of a document by taking the component-wise maximum over 3 contiguous internal vectors, representing 3 overlapping text regions, but it does this only for every other possible triplet (stride 2) instead of all the possible triplets (stride 1).", 
        "40": "This 2-stride downsampling reduces the size of the internal representation of each document by half.", 
        "41": "A number of models (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2015; He et al., 2015, 2016; Conneau et al., 2016) increase the number of feature maps whenever downsampling is performed, causing the total computational complexity to be a function of the depth.", 
        "42": "In contrast, we fix the number of feature maps, as we found that increasing the number of feature maps only does harm \u2013 increasing computation time substantially without accuracy improvement, as shown later in the experiments.", 
        "43": "With the number of feature maps fixed, the computation time for each convolution layer is halved (as the data size is halved) whenever 2-stride downsampling is performed, thus, forming a \u2018pyramid\u2019.", 
        "44": "Computation per layer is halved after every pooling.", 
        "45": "Therefore, with DPCNNs, the total computation time is bounded by a constant \u2013 twice the computation time of a single block, which makes our deep pyramid networks computationally attractive.", 
        "46": "In addition, downsampling with stride 2 essentially doubles the effective coverage (i.e., coverage in the original document) of the convolution kernel; therefore, after going through downsampling L times, associations among words within a distance in the order of 2L can be represented.", 
        "47": "Thus, deep pyramid CNN is computationally efficient for representing long-range associations and so more global information.", 
        "48": "Shortcut connections with pre-activation To enable training of deep networks, we use additive shortcut connections with identity mapping, which can be written as z + f(z) where f represents the skipped layers (He et al., 2016).", 
        "49": "In DPCNN, the skipped layers f(z) are two convolution layers with pre-activation.", 
        "50": "Here, pre-activation refers to activation being done before weighting instead of after as is typically done.", 
        "51": "That is, in the convolu-\ntion layer of DPCNN, W\u03c3(x) +b is computed at every location of each document where a column vector x represents a small region (overlapping with each other) of input at each location, \u03c3(\u00b7) is a component-wise nonlinear activation, and weights W and biases b (unique to each layer) are the parameters to be trained.", 
        "52": "The number of W\u2019s rows is the number of feature maps (also called the number of filters (He et al., 2015)) of this layer.", 
        "53": "We set activation \u03c3(\u00b7) to the rectifier \u03c3(x) = max(x, 0).", 
        "54": "In our implementation, we fixed the number of feature maps to 250 and the kernel size (the size of the small region covered by x) to 3, as shown in Figure 1a.", 
        "55": "With pre-activation, it is the results of linear weighting (W\u03c3(x) + b) that travel through the shortcut, and what is added to them at a \u2295 (Figure 1a) is also the results of linear weighting, instead of the results of nonlinear activation (\u03c3(Wx + b)).", 
        "56": "Intuitively, such \u2018linearity\u2019 eases training of deep networks, similar to the role of constant error carousels in LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuder, 1997).", 
        "57": "We empirically observed that preactivation indeed outperformed \u2018post-activation\u2019, which is in line with the image results (He et al., 2016).", 
        "58": "No need for dimension matching Although the shortcut with pre-activation was adopted from the improved ResNet of (He et al., 2016), our model is simpler than ResNet (Figure 1c), as all the\nshortcuts are exactly simple identity mapping (i.e., passing data exactly as it is) without any complication for dimension matching.", 
        "59": "When a shortcut meets the \u2018main street\u2019, the data from two paths need to have the same dimensionality so that they can be added; therefore, if a shortcut skips a layer that changes the dimensionality, e.g., by downsampling or by use of a different number of feature maps, then a shortcut must perform dimension matching.", 
        "60": "Dimension matching for increased number of feature maps, in particular, is typically done by projection, introducing more weight parameters to be trained.", 
        "61": "We eliminate the complication of dimension matching by not letting any shortcut skip a downsampling layer, and by fixing the number of feature maps throughout the network.", 
        "62": "The latter also substantially saves computation time as mentioned above, and we will show later in our experiments that on our tasks, we do not sacrifice anything for such a substantial efficiency gain.", 
        "63": "2.2 Text region embedding  A CNN for text categorization typically starts with converting each word in the text to a word vector (word embedding).", 
        "64": "We take a more general viewpoint as in (Johnson and Zhang, 2015b) and consider text region embedding \u2013 embedding of a region of text covering one or more words.", 
        "65": "Basic region embedding We start with the basic setting where there is no unsupervised embedding.", 
        "66": "In the region embedding layer we compute Wx + b for each word of a document where input x represents a k-word region (i.e., window) around the word in some straightforward manner, and weights W and bias b are trained with the parameters of other layers.", 
        "67": "Activation is delayed to the pre-activation of the next layer.", 
        "68": "Now let v be the size of vocabulary, and let us consider the following three types of straightforward representation of a k-word region for x: (1) sequential input: the kv-dimensional concatenation of k one-hot vectors; (2) bow input: a v-dimensional bag-of-word (bow) vector; and (3) bag-of-n-gram input: e.g., a bag of word uni, bi, and trigrams contained in the region.", 
        "69": "Setting the region size k = 1, they all become word embedding.", 
        "70": "A region embedding layer with the sequential input is equivalent to a convolution layer applied to a sequence of one-hot vectors representing a document, and this viewpoint was taken to de-\nscribe the first layer of ShallowCNN in (Johnson and Zhang, 2015a,b).", 
        "71": "From the region embedding viewpoint, ShallowCNN is DPCNN\u2019s special case in which a region embedding layer is directly followed by the final pooling layer (Figure 1b).", 
        "72": "A region embedding layer with region size k > 1 seeks to capture more complex concepts than single words in one weight layer, whereas a network with word embedding uses multiple weight layers to do this, e.g., word embedding followed by a convolution layer.", 
        "73": "In general, having fewer layers has a practical advantage of easier optimization.", 
        "74": "Beyond that, the optimum input type and the optimum region size can only be determined empirically.", 
        "75": "Our preliminary experiments indicated that when used with DPCNN (but not ShallowCNN), the sequential input has no advantage over the bow input \u2013 comparable accuracy with k times more weight parameters; therefore, we excluded the sequential input from our experiments2.", 
        "76": "The n-gram input turned out to be prone to overfitting in the supervised setting, likely due to its high representation power, but it is very useful as the input to unsupervised embeddings, which we discuss next.", 
        "77": "Enhancing region embedding with unsupervised embeddings In (Johnson and Zhang, 2015b, 2016), it was shown that accuracy was substantially improved by extending ShallowCNN with unsupervised embeddings obtained by tvembedding training (\u2018tv\u2019 stands for two views).", 
        "78": "We found that accuracy of DPCNN can also be improved in this manner.", 
        "79": "Below we briefly review tv-embedding training and then describe how we use the resulting unsupervised embeddings with DPCNN.", 
        "80": "The tv-embedding training requires two views.", 
        "81": "For text categorization, we define a region of text as view-1 and its adjacent regions as view-2.", 
        "82": "Then using unlabeled data, we train a neural network of one hidden layer with an artificial task of predicting view-2 from view-1.", 
        "83": "The obtained hidden layer, which is an embedding function that takes view-1 as input, serves as an unsupervised embedding function in the model for text categorization.", 
        "84": "In (Johnson and Zhang, 2015b), we showed theoretical conditions on views and labels under which\n2This differs from ShallowCNN where the sequential input is often superior to bow input.", 
        "85": "We conjecture that when bow input is used in DPCNN, convolution layers following region embedding make up for the loss of local word order caused by bow input, as they use word order.", 
        "86": "unsupervised embeddings obtained this way are useful for classification.", 
        "87": "For use with DPCNN, we train several unsupervised embeddings in this manner, which differ from one another in the region size and the vector representations of view-1 (input region) so that we can benefit from diversity.", 
        "88": "The region embedding layer of DPCNN computes Wx +\u2211\nu\u2208U W (u)z(u) + b , where x is the discrete input as in the basic region embedding, and z(u) is the output of an unsupervised embedding function indexed by u.", 
        "89": "We will show below that use of unsupervised embeddings in this way consistently improves the accuracy of DPCNN.", 
        "90": "3 Experiments  We report the experiments with DPCNNs in comparison with previous models and alternatives.", 
        "91": "The code is publicly available on the internet.",

        "157": "Comparison with non-pyramid variants Furthermore, we tested the following two \u2018nonpyramid\u2019 models for comparison.", 
        "158": "The first model doubles the number of feature maps at every other downsampling so that per-layer computation is\nkept approximately constant4.", 
        "159": "The second model performs no downsampling.", 
        "160": "Otherwise, these two models are the same as DPCNN.",

        "165": "Figure 3 is on Yelp.f, and we observed the same performance trend on the other four large datasets.", 
        "166": "Small data results Now we turn to the results on the three smaller datasets in Table 3.",

        "169": "On image, downsampling with stride 2 cancels it out as it makes data 4 times smaller by shrinking both horizontally and vertically, but text is one dimensional, and so downsampling with stride 2 merely halves data.", 
        "170": "That is why we doubled the number of feature maps at every other downsampling instead of at every downsampling to avoid exponential increase of computation time.",

        "172": "One difference from the large dataset results is that the strength of shallow models stands out.", 
        "173": "ShallowCNN (row 2) rivals DPCNN (row 1), and Zhang et al.\u2019s best linear model (row 3) moved up from the worst performer to the third best performer.", 
        "174": "The results are in line with the general fact that more complex models require more training data, and with the paucity of training data, simpler models can outperform more complex ones.",

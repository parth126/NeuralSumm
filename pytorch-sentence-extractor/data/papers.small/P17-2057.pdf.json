        "2": "Two main paradigms evolved in solving this problem: 1) answering questions on a knowledge base; and 2) answering questions using text.", 
        "3": "Knowledge bases (KB) contains facts expressed in a fixed schema, facilitating compositional reasoning.", 
        "4": "These attracted research ever since the early days of computer science, e.g., BASEBALL (Green Jr et al., 1961).", 
        "5": "This problem has matured into learning semantic parsers from parallel question and logical form pairs (Zelle and Mooney,\n1996; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005), to recent scaling of methods to work on very large KBs like Freebase using question and answer pairs (Berant et al., 2013).", 
        "6": "However, a major drawback of this paradigm is that KBs are highly incomplete (Dong et al., 2014).", 
        "7": "It is also an open question whether KB relational structure is expressive enough to represent world knowledge (Stanovsky et al., 2014; Gardner and Krishnamurthy, 2017)\nThe paradigm of exploiting text for questions started in the early 1990s (Kupiec, 1993).", 
        "8": "With the advent of web, access to text resources became abundant and cheap.", 
        "9": "Initiatives like TREC QA competitions helped popularizing this paradigm (Voorhees et al., 1999).", 
        "10": "With the recent advances in deep learning and availability of large public datasets, there has been an explosion of research in a very short time (Rajpurkar et al., 2016; Trischler et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2016; Wang and Jiang, 2016; Lee et al., 2016; Xiong et al., 2016; Seo et al., 2016; Choi et al., 2016).", 
        "11": "Still, text representation is unstructured and does not allow the compositional reasoning which structured KB supports.", 
        "12": "An important but under-explored QA paradigm is where KB and text are exploited together (Ferrucci et al., 2010).", 
        "13": "Such combination is attractive because text contains millions of facts not present in KB, and a KB\u2019s generative capacity represents infinite number of facts that are never seen in text.",

        "86": "Although the text-based question answering datasets are large in size, e.g., SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) has over 100k questions, answers to these are often not entities but rather sentences which are not the focus of our work.",

        "108": "The word and entity embeddings were initialized with word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) trained on 7.5\nmillion ClueWeb sentences containing entities in Freebase subset of SPADES.", 
        "109": "The network weights were initialized using Xavier initialization (Glorot and Bengio, 2010).", 
        "110": "We considered up to a maximum of 5k KB facts and 2.5k textual facts for a question.", 
        "111": "We used Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015) with the default hyperparameters (learning rate=1e3, \u03b21=0.9, \u03b22=0.999, \u03b5=1e-8) for optimization.",

        "115": "We found that this is crucial in making the UNISCHEMA to work.", 
        "116": "Another caveat is the need to employ a trick similar to batch normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015).", 
        "117": "For each minibatch, we normalize the mean and variance of the textual facts and then scale and shift to match the mean and variance of the KB memory facts.", 
        "118": "Empirically, this stabilized the training and gave a boost in the final performance.", 
        "119": "4.4 Results and Discussions  Table 1 shows the main results on SPADES.", 
        "120": "UNISCHEMA outperforms all our models validating our hypothesis that exploiting universal schema for QA is better than using either KB or text alone.", 
        "121": "Despite SPADES creation process being friendly to Freebase, exploiting text still provides a significant improvement.", 
        "122": "Table 2 shows some of the questions which UNISCHEMA answered but ONLYKB failed.", 
        "123": "These can be broadly classified into (a) relations that are not expressed in Freebase (e.g., african-american presidents in sentence 1); (b) intentional facts since curated databases only represent concrete facts rather than intentions (e.g., threating to leave in sentence 2); (c) comparative predicates like first, second, largest, smallest (e.g., sentences 3 and 4); and (d) providing addi-\ntional type constraints (e.g., in sentence 5, Freebase does not have a special relation for father.", 
        "124": "It can be expressed using the relation parent along with the type constraint that the answer is of gender male).", 
        "125": "We have also anlalyzed the nature of UNISCHEMA attention.", 
        "126": "In 58.7% of the cases the attention tends to prefer KB facts over text.", 
        "127": "This is as expected since KBs facts are concrete and accurate than text.", 
        "128": "In 34.8% of cases, the memory prefers to attend text even if the fact is already present in the KB.", 
        "129": "For the rest (6.5%), the memory distributes attention weight evenly, indicating for some questions, part of the evidence comes from text and part of it from KB.", 
        "130": "Table 3 gives a more detailed quantitative analysis of the three models in comparison with each other.", 
        "131": "To see how reliable is UNISCHEMA, we gradually increased the coverage of KB by allowing only a fixed number of randomly chosen KB facts for each entity.", 
        "132": "As Figure 2 shows, when the KB coverage is less than 16 facts per entity, UNISCHEMA outperforms ONLYKB by a wide-margin indicating UNISCHEMA is robust even in resource-scarce scenario, whereas ONLYKB is very sensitive to the coverage.",

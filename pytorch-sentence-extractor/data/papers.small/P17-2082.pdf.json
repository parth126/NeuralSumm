        "2": "The aim of this task is to identify the type of relation between two entities in a given text.", 
        "3": "Most work on RE has mainly regarded the application of supervised methods, which require costly annotation, especially for large-scale datasets.",

        "7": "Although DS has\nshown to be promising for RE, it also produces many noisy labels in the automatic annotated data, which deteriorate the performance of the system trained on it.",

        "9": "(2011) showed that by simply adding a small set of high quality labeled instances (i.e., human-annotated training data) to a larger set of instances annotated by DS, makes the overall precision of the system significantly increases.", 
        "10": "Such level of quality of the labels usually can be obtained at low cost via crowdsourcing.", 
        "11": "However, this finding does not hold for more complex tasks, where the annotators1 need to have some expertise on them.", 
        "12": "For instance in RE, several works have shown that only a marginal improvement can be achieved via crowdsourcing the data (Angeli et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2012; Pershina et al., 2014).", 
        "13": "In such papers, the wellknown Gold Standard quality control mechanism was used without annotators being trained.",

        "26": "This is in line with the studies in human-based computational approaches, which showed that the crowd intelligence can effectively alleviate the drifting problem in auto-annotation systems (Sun et al., 2014; Russakovsky et al., 2015).",

        "31": "Many researchers have exploited the techniques of combining the DS data with small human annotated data collected via crowdsourcing, to improve the relation extractor accuracy (Liu et al., 2016; Angeli et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2012).", 
        "32": "Angeli et al.", 
        "33": "(2014) reported a minor improvement using active learning methods to select the best instances to be crowdsourced.", 
        "34": "In the same direction, Zhang et al.", 
        "35": "(2012) studied the effect of providing human feedback in crowdsourcing tasks and observed a minor improvement in terms of F1.", 
        "36": "At high level, our work may be viewed as employing crowdsourcing for RE.", 
        "37": "In that spirit, we are similar to these works, but with the main difference of training crowd workers to obtain higher quality annotations.", 
        "38": "The most related paper to our work is by Liu et al.", 
        "39": "(2016), who trained the crowd workers via \u201cGated Instruction\u201d.", 
        "40": "They also showed that collecting higher-quality annotations can be achieved through training the workers.", 
        "41": "The produced data also improved the performance of the RE systems trained on it.", 
        "42": "Our study confirms their finding.", 
        "43": "However, unlike them, we do not employ any Gold Standard (annotated by experts) for training the annotators and instead we propose a self-training strategy to select a set of high-quality automatic annotated data (namely, Silver Standard).", 
        "44": "3 Self-Crowdsourcing Training  In this section we first explain, our proposed method for automatically identifying high-quality examples (i.e., Silver Standard) to train the crowd workers and collect annotations for the lowerquality examples.", 
        "45": "We then explain the scheme designed for crowd worker training and annotation collection.", 
        "46": "3.1 Silver Standard Mining  The main idea of our approach to SelfCrowdsourcing training is to use the classifier\u2019s score for gradually training the crowd workers, such that the examples and labels associated with the highest prediction values (i.e., the most reliable) will be used as Silver Standard.", 
        "47": "More in detail, our approach is based on a noisy-label dataset, DS, whose labels are extracted in a distant supervision fashion and CS a dataset to be labeled by the crowd.", 
        "48": "The first step is to divide CS into three parts: CSI , which is used to create the instructions for the crowd workers; CSQ, which is used for asking questions about sentence annotations; and CSA, which is used to collect the labels from annotators, after they have been trained.", 
        "49": "To select CSI , we train a classifier C on DS, and then used it to label CS examples.", 
        "50": "In particular, we used MultiR framework (Hoffmann et al., 2011) to train C, as it is a widely used framework for RE.", 
        "51": "Then, we sort CS in a descending order according to the classifier prediction scores and select the first Ni elements, obtaining CSI .", 
        "52": "Next, we select the Nq examples of CS \\ CSI with the highest score to create the set CSQ.", 
        "53": "Note that the latter contains highly-reliable classifier annotations but since the scores are lower than for\nCSI examples, we conjecture that they may be more difficult to be annotated by the crowd workers.", 
        "54": "Finally, CSA is assigned with the remaining examples, i.e., CS \\ CSI \\ CSQ.", 
        "55": "These have the lowest confidence and should therefore be annotated by crowd workers.", 
        "56": "Ni and Nq can be tuned on the task, we set both to 10% of the data.", 
        "57": "3.2 Training Schema  We conducted crowd worker training and annotation collection using the well-known Crowdflower platform2.", 
        "58": "Given CSI and CSQ (see Section 3.1), we train the annotators in two steps:\n(i) User Instruction: first, a definition of each relation type (borrowed from TAC-KBP official guideline) is shown to the annotators.", 
        "59": "This initial training step provides the crowd workers with a big picture of the task.", 
        "60": "We then train the annotators showing them a set of examples from CSI (see Fig.", 
        "61": "1).", 
        "62": "The latter are presented in the reverse order of difficulty.", 
        "63": "The ranked list of examples provided by our self-training strategy facilitates the gradual education of the annotators (Nosofsky, 2011).", 
        "64": "This gives us the benefit of training the annotators with any level of expertise, which is a crucial property of crowdsourcing when there is no clue about the workers\u2019 expertise in advance.", 
        "65": "(ii) Interactive QA: after the initial step, we challenge the workers in an interactive QA task with multiple-choice questions over the sentence annotation (see Fig.", 
        "66": "2).", 
        "67": "To accomplish that, we designed an artificial agent that interacts with the crowd workers: it corrects their mistakes and makes them reasoning on why their answer was wrong.", 
        "68": "Note that, to have a better control of the\n2www.crowdflower.com\nworker training, we perform a selection of the sentences in CSQ to be used for questioning in a category-wise fashion.", 
        "69": "Meaning that, we select the subsets of examples for each class of relation separately.", 
        "70": "We observed in practice that initially a lot of examples are classified as \u201cNo Relation\u201d.", 
        "71": "This is due to a difficulty of the task for the DS-based model.", 
        "72": "Thus, we used them in CSA.", 
        "73": "4 Experimental Setup  In this section, we first introduce the details of the used corpora, then explain the feature extraction and RE pipeline and finally present the experiments and discuss the results in detail.", 
        "74": "4.1 Corpora  We used TAC-KBP newswires, one of the most well-known corpora for RE task.", 
        "75": "As DS, we selected 700K sentences automatically annotated using Freebase as an external KB.", 
        "76": "We used the active learning framework proposed by Angeli et al.", 
        "77": "(2014) to select CS.", 
        "78": "This allowed us to select the best sentences to be annotated by humans (sampleJS).", 
        "79": "As a result, we obtained 4,388 sentences.", 
        "80": "We divided the CS sentences in CSI , CSQ and CSA, with 10%, 10% and 80% split, respectively.", 
        "81": "We requested at least 5 annotations for each sentence.", 
        "82": "Similarly to Liu et al.", 
        "83": "(2016), we restricted our attention to 5 relations between person and location3.", 
        "84": "For both DS and CS, we used the publicly available data provided by Liu et al.", 
        "85": "(2016).", 
        "86": "Ultimately, 221 crowd workers participated to the task with minimum 2 and maximum 400 annotations per crowd worker.", 
        "87": "To evaluate our model, we randomly selected 200 sentences as test set and had\n3Nationality, Place-of-birth, Place-of-resident, Place-ofdeath, Traveled-to\na domain expert to manually tag them using the TAC-KBP annotation guidelines.", 
        "88": "4.2 Relation Extraction Pipeline  We used the relation extractor, MultiR (Hoffmann et al., 2010) along with lexical and syntactic features proposed by Mintz et al.", 
        "89": "(2009) such as: (i) Part of Speech (POS); (ii) windows of k words around the matched entities; (iii) the sequences of words between them; and (iv) finally, dependency structure patterns between entity pairs.", 
        "90": "These yield low-Recall as they appear in conjunctive forms but at the same time they produce a high Precision.", 
        "91": "4.3 Experimental Results  In the first set of experiments, we verified the quality of our Silver Standard set used in our selftraining methods.", 
        "92": "For this purpose, we trained MultiR on CSI , CSQ and CSA and evaluate them on our test set.", 
        "93": "Figure 3 illustrates the results in terms of Precision, Recall and F1 for each partition separately.", 
        "94": "They suggest that, the extractors trained on CSI and CSQ are significantly better than the extractor trained on the lower part of CS, i.e., CSA, even if the latter is much larger than the other two (80% vs. 10%).", 
        "95": "In the next set of experiments, we evaluated the impact of adding a small set of crowdsourced data to a large set of instances annotated by Distant Supervision.", 
        "96": "We conducted the RE experiments in this setting, as this allowed us to directly compare with Liu et al.", 
        "97": "(2016).", 
        "98": "Thus, we used CSA annotated by our proposed method along with the noisy annotated DS to train the extractor.", 
        "99": "We compared our method with (i) the DS-only baseline and (ii) the state of the art, Gated Instruction (GI) strategy (Liu et al., 2016).", 
        "100": "We emphasize that the same set of examples (both DS and CS) are used in this experiment and just replaced the GI annotations with the annotations collected using our proposed framework.", 
        "101": "The results are shown in Table 1.", 
        "102": "Our method improves the DS-only baseline by 7%, 5% and 2% (absolute) in Precision, Recall and F1, respectively.", 
        "103": "This improvement clearly confirms the benefit of our fully automatic approach to crowdsourcing in RE task.", 
        "104": "Additionally, our model is just 3% lower than the GI method in terms of F1.", 
        "105": "In both our method and GI, the crowd workers are trained before enrolling in the main task.", 
        "106": "However, GI trains annotators using Gold Standard data, which involves a higher level of supervision with respect to our method.", 
        "107": "Thus our self-training method is potentially effective and an inexpensive alternative to GI.", 
        "108": "We also analyzed the accuracy of the crowd workers in terms of the quality of their annotations.", 
        "109": "For this purpose, we randomly selected 100 sentences from CSA and then had them manually annotated by an expert.", 
        "110": "We compared the accuracy of the annotations collected with our proposed approach with those provided by DS-only baseline and the GI method.", 
        "111": "Table 2 shows the results: the annotations performed by workers trained with our method are just slightly less accurate than the annotations produced by annotators trained with GI.", 
        "112": "This outcome is inline with the positive impact of our good quality annotation on the RE performance.", 
        "113": "5 Conclusion  In this paper, we have proposed a self-training strategy for crowdsourcing as an effective alternative to train annotators with Gold Standard.", 
        "114": "Our experimental results show that the annotations of workers trained with our method are accurate and produce a good performance when used in learning algorithms for RE.", 
        "115": "Our study suggests that automatically training annotators can replace the popular consensus-based filtering scheme.", 
        "116": "Our method achieves this goal through an inexpensive training procedure.", 
        "117": "In the future, it would be interesting to study if our method generalizes to other difficult or even simpler tasks.", 
        "118": "In particular, our approach opens up many research directions on how to best train\nworkers or best select data for them, similarly to what active learning methods have been doing for training machines.",

        "162": "Perhaps we can also caution against a simple adherence to Firth (1957) \u201cYou shall know a word by the company it keeps\u201d.", 
        "163": "This does not appear to be the case in our experiments as PreWin regularly performs better than the \u201cimmediate\u201d baseline.", 
        "164": "Further prototypical examples of the method can be viewed in the Appendix.", 
        "165": "Our intuition that most words in the sentence, indeed in the paragraph do not carry the semantic information required to classify the target entity is ultimately based on evidence.", 
        "166": "The model uses only a small window, linked to the entity via a head dependency relationship for the final classification decision.", 
        "167": "5.3 Common Errors  Most of the time (typically 85% for the two datasets), PreWin is sufficient for an accurate classification.", 
        "168": "However, it does not work well in some cases.", 
        "169": "The typical 15% error rate breaks down as follows (percentages were estimated based on extensive experimentation and observation):\nDiscarding important context (3%): Sometimes the 5 or 10 word \u201cimmediate\u201d baseline method would actually have been preferred such as in the sentence \u201c...REF in 2014 ranked Essex in the top 20 universities...\u201d.", 
        "170": "PreWin discards the right-hand side input, which is required in this case for a correct classification.", 
        "171": "Since \u201dranked\u201d is the head of \u201dEssex\u201d, the rest of the sentence gets ignored and the valuable context gets lost.", 
        "172": "More complex semantic patterns (11%): Many common mistakes were due to the lack\nof the model\u2019s understanding of more complex predicates such as in the following sentences: \u201c ...of military presence of Germany.\u201d, \u201cHouston also served as a member and treasurer of the...\u201d or \u201d...invitations were extended to Yugoslavia ...\u201d.", 
        "173": "We think this is due to a lack of training data (around 1,000 sentences per dataset).", 
        "174": "Additional examples such as \u201c...days after the tour had exited Belgium.\u201d expose some of the limitations of the neural model to recognise uncommon ways of expressing a reference to a literal place.", 
        "175": "Recall that no external resources or tools were used to supplement the training/features, the model had to learn to generalise from what it has seen during training, which was limited in our experiments.", 
        "176": "Parsing mistakes (1%): were less common though still present.", 
        "177": "It is important to choose the right dependency parser for the task since different parsers will often generate slightly different parse trees.", 
        "178": "We have used SpaCy8 for all our experiments, which is a Python-based industrial strength NLP library.", 
        "179": "Sometimes, tokenisation errors for acronyms like \u201cU.S.A.\u201d and wrongly hyphenated words may also cause parsing errors, however, this was infrequent.", 
        "180": "5.4 Flexibility of Neural Model  The top accuracy figures for ReLocaR are almost identical to SemEval.", 
        "181": "The highest single model\n8https://spacy.io/\naccuracy for ReLocaR was 83.6% (84.8% with Ensemble), which was within 0.5% of the equivalent methods for SemEval (83.1%, 84.6% for Ensemble).", 
        "182": "Both were achieved using the same methods (PreWin or Ensemble), neural architecture and size of corpora.", 
        "183": "When the models were trained on the CoNLL data, the accuracies were 82.8% and 79.5%.", 
        "184": "However, when the models trained on ReLocaR and tested on SemEval (and vice versa), accuracy dropped to between 62.4% and 69% showing that what was learnt does not seem to transfer well to another dataset.", 
        "185": "We think the reason for this is the difference in annotation guidelines; the government is a metonymic reading, not a literal one.", 
        "186": "This causes the model to make more mistakes.", 
        "187": "5.5 Ensemble Method  The highest accuracy and f-scores were achieved with the ensemble method for both datasets.", 
        "188": "We combined three models (previously described in section 4.5) for SemEval to achieve 84.6% accuracy and three models for ReLocaR to achieve 84.8% for the new dataset.", 
        "189": "Training separate models with different parameters and/or on different datasets does increase classification capability as various models learn distinct aspects of the task, enabling the 1.2 - 1.5% improvement.", 
        "190": "5.6 Dimensionality of Word Embeddings  We found that increasing dimension size (up to 300) did not materially improve performance.", 
        "191": "The neural network tended to overfit, even with fewer epochs, the results were comparable to our default 50-dimensional embeddings.", 
        "192": "We posit that fewer dimensions of the distributed word representations force the abstraction level higher as the meaning of words must be expressed more succinctly.", 
        "193": "We think this helps the model generalise better, particularly for smaller datasets.", 
        "194": "Lastly, learning word embeddings from scratch on datasets this small (around 1,000 samples) is possible but impractical, the performance typically decreases by around 5% if word embeddings are not initialised first.", 
        "195": "Dataset / Method Literal Non-Literal  5.7 F-Scores and Class Imbalance  Table 3 shows the SOTA f-scores, our best results for SemEval 2007 and the best f-scores for ReLocaR.", 
        "196": "The class imbalance inside SemEval (80% literal, 18% metonymic, 2% mixed) is reflected as a high bias in the final model.", 
        "197": "This is not the case with ReLocaR and its 49% literal, 49% metonymic and 2% mixed ratio of 3 classes.", 
        "198": "The model was equally capable of distinguishing between literal and non-literal cases.", 
        "199": "5.8 Another baseline  There was another baseline we tested, however, it was not covered anywhere so far because of its low performance.", 
        "200": "It was a type of extreme parse tree pruning, during which most of the sentence gets discarded and we only retain 3 to 4 content words.", 
        "201": "The method uses non-local (long range) dependencies to construct a short input sequence.", 
        "202": "However, the method was a case of ignoring too many relevant words and accuracy was fluctuating in the mid-60% range, which is why we did not report the results.", 
        "203": "However, it serves to further justify the choice of 5 words as the predicate window as fewer words caused the model to underperform.", 
        "204": "6 Discussion    6.1 NER, GP and Metonymy  We think the next frontier is a NER tagger, which actively handles metonymy.", 
        "205": "The task of labelling entities should be mainly driven by context rather than the word\u2019s surface form.", 
        "206": "If the target entity looks like \u201cLondon\u201d, this should not mean the entity is automatically a location.", 
        "207": "Metonymy is a frequent linguistic phenomenon (around 20% of location mentions are metonymic, see section 3.1) and could be handled by NER taggers to enable many innovative downstream NLP applications.", 
        "208": "Geographical Parsing is a pertinent use case.", 
        "209": "In order to monitor/mine text documents for geographical information only, the current NER technology does not have a solution.", 
        "210": "We think it is incorrect for any NER tagger to label \u201cVancouver\u201d as a location in \u201cVancouver welcomes you!\u201d.", 
        "211": "A better output might be something like the following: Vancouver = location AND metonymy = True.", 
        "212": "This means Vancouver is usually a location but is used metonymically in this case.", 
        "213": "How this information is used will be up to the developer.", 
        "214": "Organisations behaving as persons, share prices or products are but a few other examples of metonymy.", 
        "215": "6.2 Simplicity and Minimalism  Previous work in MR such as most of the SemEval 2007 participants (Farkas et al., 2007; Nicolae et al., 2007; Leveling, 2007; Brun et al., 2007; Poibeau, 2007) and the more recent contributions used a selection of many of the following features/tools for classification: handmade trigger word lists, WordNet, VerbNet, FrameNet, extra features generated/learnt from parsing Wikipedia (approx 3B words) and BNC (approx 100M words), custom databases, handcrafted features, multiple (sometimes proprietary) parsers, Levin\u2019s verb classes, 3,000 extra training instances from a corpus called MAScARA9 by Markert and Nissim (2002) and other extra resources including the SemEval Task 8 features.", 
        "216": "We managed to achieve comparable performance with a small neural network typically trained in no more than 5 epochs, minimal training data, a basic dependency parser and the new PreWin method by being highly discriminating in choosing signal over noise.", 
        "217": "9http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mnissim/mascara/  7 Conclusions and Future Work  We showed how a minimalist neural approach can replace substantial external resources, handcrafted features and how the PreWin method can even ignore most of the paragraph where the entity is positioned and still achieve competitive performance in metonymy resolution.", 
        "218": "The pressing new question is: \u201cHow much better the performance could have been if our method availed itself of the extra training data and resources used by previous works?\u201d Indeed this may be the next research chapter for PreWin.", 
        "219": "We discussed how tasks such as Geographical Parsing can benefit from \u201cmetonymy-enhanced\u201d NER tagging.", 
        "220": "We have also presented a case for better annotation guidelines for MR (after consulting with a number of linguists), which now means that a government is not a literal class, rather it is a metonymic one.", 
        "221": "We fully agreed with the rest of the previous annotation guidelines.", 
        "222": "We also introduced ReLocaR, a new corpus for (location) metonymy resolution and encourage researchers to make effective use of it (including the additional CoNLL 2003 subset we annotated for metonymy).", 
        "223": "Future work may involve testing PreWin on an NER task to see if and how it can generalise to a different classification task and how the results compare to the SOTA and similar methods such as that of Collobert et al.", 
        "224": "(2011) using the CoNLL 2003 NER datasets.", 
        "225": "Word Sense Disambiguation (Yarowsky, 2010; Pilehvar and Navigli, 2014) with neural networks (Melamud et al., 2016) is another related classification task suitable for testing PreWin.", 
        "226": "If it does perform better, this will be of considerable interest to classification research (and beyond) in NLP.",

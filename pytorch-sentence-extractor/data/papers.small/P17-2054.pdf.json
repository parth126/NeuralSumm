        "1": "  Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Short Papers), pages 341\u2013346 Vancouver, Canada, July 30 - August 4, 2017. c\u00a92017 Association for Computational Linguistics\nhttps://doi.org/10.18653/v1/P17-2054  1 Introduction  The scientific keyphrase boundary classification (KBC) task consists of a) determining keyphrase boundaries, and b) labelling keyphrases with their types according to a predefined schema.", 
        "2": "KBC is motivated by the need to efficiently search scientific literature, which can be summarised by their keyphrases.", 
        "3": "Several companies are working on keyphrase-based recommender systems for scientific literature or search interfaces where scientific articles decorate graphs, in which nodes are keyphrases.", 
        "4": "Such keyphrases must be dynamically retrieved from the articles, because important scientific concepts emerge on a daily basis, and the most recent concepts are typically the ones of interest to scientists.", 
        "5": "KBC is not a common task in NLP, and there are only few small annotated datasets for inducing supervised KBC models, made available recently\n?Both authors contributed equally\n(QasemiZadeh and Schumann, 2016; Augenstein et al., 2017).", 
        "6": "Typical KBC approaches therefore rely on hand-crafted gazetteers (Hasan and Ng, 2014) or reduce the task to extracting a list of keyphrases for each document (Kim et al., 2010) instead of identifying mentions of keyphrases in sentences.", 
        "7": "For related more common NLP tasks such as named entity recognition and identification of multi-word expressions, neural sequence labelling methods have been shown to be useful (Lample et al., 2016).", 
        "8": "In order to overcome the small data problem, we study using more widely available data for tasks related to KBC and exploit their synergies in a deep multi-task learning setup.", 
        "9": "Multi-task learning has become popular within natural language processing and machine learning over the last few years; in particular, hard parameter sharing of hidden layers in deep learning models.", 
        "10": "This approach to multi-task learning has three advantages: a) It significantly reduces Rademacher complexity (Baxter, 2000; Maurer, 2007), i.e., the risk of over-fitting, b) it is spaceefficient, reducing the number of parameters, and c) it is easy to implement.", 
        "11": "This paper shows how hard parameter sharing can be used to improve gazetteer-free keyphrase boundary classification models, by exploiting different syntactically and semantically annotated corpora, as well as more readily available data such as hyperlinks.", 
        "12": "Contributions We study the so far widely underexplored, though in practice important task of scientific keyphrase boundary classification, for which only a small amount of training data is available.", 
        "13": "We overcome this by identifying good auxiliary tasks and cast it as a multi-task learning problem.", 
        "14": "We evaluate our models across two new, manually annotated corpora of scientific articles and outperform single-task approaches by up\n341\nto 9.64% F1, mostly due to better performance for long keyphrases.", 
        "15": "2 Keyphrase Boundary Classification  Consider the following sentence from a scientific paper:\n(1) We find that simple interpolation methods, like log-linear and linear interpolation, improve the performance but fall short of the performance of an oracle.", 
        "16": "This sentence occurs in the ACL RD-TEC 2.0 corpus.", 
        "17": "Here, interpolation methods and loglinear and linear interpolation are annotated as technical keyphrases, performance as a keyphrase related to measurements, and oracle is a keyphrase labelled as miscellaneous.", 
        "18": "Below, we are interested in predicting the boundaries and the types of all keyphrases.", 
        "19": "3 Multi-Task Learning  Multi-task learning is an approach to learning, in which generalisation is improved by taking advantage of the inductive bias in training signals of related tasks.", 
        "20": "When abundant labelled data is available for an auxiliary task, but little data for the target task, multi-task learning can act as a form of semi-supervised learning combined with a distant supervision signal.", 
        "21": "Inducing a model from only the sparse target task data may lead to overfitting to random noise in the data, but relying on auxiliary data helps the model generalise, making it easier to abstract away from noise, as well as leveraging the marginal distribution of auxiliary input data.", 
        "22": "From a representation learning perspective, auxiliary tasks can be used to induce representations that may be beneficial for the target task.", 
        "23": "Caruana (1993) also suggests that the auxiliary task can help focus attention in the induction of the target task model.", 
        "24": "Finally, multi-task learning can be cast as a regulariser as studies show reductions in Rademacher complexity in multi-task architectures over single-task architectures (Baxter, 2000; Maurer, 2007).", 
        "25": "Here, we follow the probably most common approach to multi-task learning, known as hard parameter sharing.", 
        "26": "This was introduced in Caruana (1993) in the context of deep neural networks, in which hidden layers can be shared among tasks.", 
        "27": "We assume T different training set, D1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , DT ,\nwhere each Dt contains pairs of input-output sequences (w1:n, yt1:n), wi 2 V , yti 2 Lt.", 
        "28": "The input vocabulary V is shared across tasks, but the output vocabularies (tagset) Lt are task dependent.", 
        "29": "At each step in the training process we choose a random task t, followed by a random training instance (w1:n, yt1:n) 2 Dt.", 
        "30": "We use the tagger to predict the labels y\u0302ti , suffer a loss with respect to the true labels yti and update the model parameters.", 
        "31": "The parameters are trained jointly for a sentence, i.e.", 
        "32": "cross-entropy loss over each sentence is employed.", 
        "33": "Each task is associated with an independent classification function, but all tasks share the hidden layers.", 
        "34": "Note that for our experiments, we only consider one auxiliary task at a time.", 
        "35": "4 Experiments  Experimental Setup We perform experiments for both keyphrase boundary identification (unlabelled), and keyphrase boundary identification and classification (labelled).", 
        "36": "Metrics measured are token-level precision, recall and F1, which are micro-average results across keyphrase types.", 
        "37": "Types are defined by the two datasets studied.", 
        "38": "Auxiliary tasks We experiment with five auxiliary tasks: (1) syntactic chunking using annotations extracted from the English Penn Treebank, following S\u00f8gaard and Goldberg (2016); (2) frame target annotations from FrameNet 1.5 (corresponding to the target identification and classification tasks in Das et al.", 
        "39": "(2014)); (3) hyperlink prediction using the dataset from Spitkovsky et al.", 
        "40": "(2010), (4) identification of multi-word expressions using the Streusle corpus (Schneider and Smith, 2015); and (5) semantic super-sense tagging using the Semcor dataset, following Johannsen et al.", 
        "41": "(2014).", 
        "42": "We train our models on the main task with one auxiliary task at a time.", 
        "43": "Note that the datasets for the auxiliary tasks are not annotated with keyphrase boundary identification or classification labels.", 
        "44": "Datasets We evaluate on the SemEval 2017 Task 10 dataset (Augenstein et al., 2017) and the the ACL RD-TEC 2.0 dataset (QasemiZadeh and Schumann, 2016).", 
        "45": "The SemEval 2017 dataset is annotated with three keyphrase types, the ACL RD-TEC dataset with seven.", 
        "46": "For the former, we test on the development portion of the dataset, as the test set is not released yet.", 
        "47": "We randomly split ACL RD-TEC into a training and test set, reserv-\ning 1/3 for testing.", 
        "48": "Key dataset characteristics are summarised in Table 1.", 
        "49": "One important observation is that the SemEval 2017 dataset contains a significantly higher proportion of long keyphrases than the ACL dataset.", 
        "50": "Models Our single- and multi-task networks are three-layer, bi-directional LSTMs (Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005) with pre-trained SENNA embeddings.1 For the multi-task networks, we follow the training procedure outlined in Section 3.", 
        "51": "The dimensionality of the embeddings is 50, and we follow S\u00f8gaard and Goldberg (2016) in using the same dimensionality for the hidden layers.", 
        "52": "We add a dropout of 0.1 to the input and train these architectures with momentum SGD with initial learning rate of 0.001 and momentum of 0.9 for 10 epochs.",

        "57": "5 Results and Analysis  Results for SemEval 2017 Task 10 corpus are presented in Table 2, and for the ACL RD-TEC corpus in Table 3.", 
        "58": "For the SemEval corpus, all five labelled multi-task learning models outperform both examples of previous work, as well as our singletask BiLSTM baseline, by some margin.",

        "61": "The lexicalised Finkel et al.", 
        "62": "(2005) model shows a surprisingly competitive performance on the ACL RD-TEC corpus, where it is only 2 points in F1 behind our best performing labelled model and on par with our bestperforming unlabelled model.", 
        "63": "Results with Lample et al.", 
        "64": "(2016), on the other hand, are lower than the Finkel et al.", 
        "65": "(2005) baseline.", 
        "66": "This might be due to the model having a large set of parameters to model state transitions which poses a difficulty for small training datasets.", 
        "67": "Overall, multi-task models show bigger improvements over baselines for the SemEval corpus, and all models achieve better results on ACL RD-TEC.", 
        "68": "Statistics shown in Table 1 help to explain this.", 
        "69": "Most noticeably, the SemEval dataset contains a significantly higher proportion of long keyphrases than the ACL dataset.", 
        "70": "Interestingly, ACL RD-TEC contains a large proportion of keyphrases which only appear once in the training set (singletons), significantly fewer keyphrases and more keyphrase type, but that does not seem to impact results as much as a high proportion of long keyphrases.", 
        "71": "All models struggle with semantically vague or broad keyphrases (e.g.", 
        "72": "\u2018items\u2019, \u2018scope\u2019, \u2018key\u2019) and long keyphrases, especially those containing clauses (e.g.",

        "153": "However, using better input encoding allowing virtual look-ahead and look-behind in the token representation, TUPABiLSTM obtains substantially higher scores than TUPAMLP and all other parsers, on both primary and remote edges, both in the in-domain and out-of-domain settings.", 
        "154": "Its performance in absolute terms, of 73.5% F-score on primary edges, is encouraging in light of UCCA\u2019s inter-annotator agreement of 80\u201385% F-score on them (Abend and Rappoport, 2013).", 
        "155": "The parsers resulting from tree approximation 10The low upper bound for remote edges is partly due to the removal of implicit nodes (not supported in bilexical representations), where the whole sub-graph headed by such nodes, often containing remote edges, must be discarded.", 
        "156": "are unable to recover any remote edges, as these are removed in the conversion.11 The bilexical DAG parsers are quite limited in this respect as well.", 
        "157": "While some of the DAG parsers\u2019 difficulty can be attributed to the conversion upper bound of 58.3%, this in itself cannot account for their poor performance on remote edges, which is an order of magnitude lower than that of TUPABiLSTM.", 
        "158": "6 Related Work  While earlier work on anchored12 semantic parsing has mostly concentrated on shallow semantic analysis, focusing on semantic role labeling of verbal argument structures, the focus has recently shifted to parsing of more elaborate representations that account for a wider range of phenomena (Abend and Rappoport, 2017).", 
        "159": "Grammar-Based Parsing.", 
        "160": "Linguistically expressive grammars such as HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994), CCG (Steedman, 2000) and TAG (Joshi and Schabes, 1997) provide a theory of the syntax-semantics interface, and have been used as a basis for semantic parsers by defining com-\n11We also experimented with a simpler version of TUPA lacking REMOTE transitions, obtaining an increase of up to 2 labeled F-score points on primary edges, at the cost of not being able to predict remote edges.", 
        "161": "12By anchored we mean that the semantic representation directly corresponds to the words and phrases of the text.", 
        "162": "positional semantics on top of them (Flickinger, 2000; Bos, 2005, among others).", 
        "163": "Depending on the grammar and the implementation, such semantic parsers can support some or all of the structural properties UCCA exhibits.", 
        "164": "Nevertheless, this line of work differs from our approach in two important ways.", 
        "165": "First, the representations are different.", 
        "166": "UCCA does not attempt to model the syntaxsemantics interface and is thus less coupled with syntax.", 
        "167": "Second, while grammar-based parsers explicitly model syntax, our approach directly models the relation between tokens and semantic structures, without explicit composition rules.", 
        "168": "Broad-Coverage Semantic Parsing.", 
        "169": "Most closely related to this work is Broad-Coverage Semantic Dependency Parsing (SDP), addressed in two SemEval tasks (Oepen et al., 2014, 2015).", 
        "170": "Like UCCA parsing, SDP addresses a wide range of semantic phenomena, and supports discontinuous units and reentrancy.", 
        "171": "In SDP, however, bilexical dependencies are used, and a head must be selected for every relation\u2014even in constructions that have no clear head, such as coordination (Ivanova et al., 2012).", 
        "172": "The use of non-terminal nodes is a simple way to avoid this liability.", 
        "173": "SDP also differs from UCCA in the type of distinctions it makes, which are more tightly coupled with syntactic considerations, where UCCA aims to capture purely semantic cross-linguistically applicable notions.", 
        "174": "For instance, the \u201cposs\u201d label in the DM target representation is used to annotate syntactic possessive constructions, regardless of whether they correspond to semantic ownership (e.g., \u201cJohn\u2019s dog\u201d) or other semantic relations, such as marking an argument of a nominal predicate (e.g., \u201cJohn\u2019s kick\u201d).", 
        "175": "UCCA reflects the difference between these constructions.", 
        "176": "Recent interest in SDP has yielded numerous works on graph parsing (Ribeyre et al., 2014; Thomson et al., 2014; Almeida and Martins, 2015; Du et al., 2015), including tree approximation (Agic\u0301 and Koller, 2014; Schluter et al., 2014) and joint syntactic/semantic parsing (Henderson et al., 2013; Swayamdipta et al., 2016).", 
        "177": "Abstract Meaning Representation.", 
        "178": "Another line of work addresses parsing into AMRs (Flanigan et al., 2014; Vanderwende et al., 2015; Pust et al., 2015; Artzi et al., 2015), which, like UCCA, abstract away from syntactic distinctions and represent meaning directly, using OntoNotes predi-\ncates (Weischedel et al., 2013).", 
        "179": "Events in AMR may also be evoked by non-verbal predicates, including possessive constructions.", 
        "180": "Unlike in UCCA, the alignment between AMR concepts and the text is not explicitly marked.", 
        "181": "While sharing much of this work\u2019s motivation, not anchoring the representation in the text complicates the parsing task, as it requires the alignment to be automatically (and imprecisely) detected.", 
        "182": "Indeed, despite considerable technical effort (Flanigan et al., 2014; Pourdamghani et al., 2014; Werling et al., 2015), concept identification is only about 80%\u201390% accurate.", 
        "183": "Furthermore, anchoring allows breaking down sentences into semantically meaningful sub-spans, which is useful for many applications (Ferna\u0301ndez-Gonza\u0301lez and Martins, 2015; Birch et al., 2016).", 
        "184": "Several transition-based AMR parsers have been proposed: CAMR assumes syntactically parsed input, processing dependency trees into AMR (Wang et al., 2015a,b, 2016; Goodman et al., 2016).",

        "190": "(2016) perform concept identification and parsing jointly.", 
        "191": "UCCA parsing does not require separately aligning the input tokens to the graph.", 
        "192": "TUPA creates non-terminal units as part of the parsing process.", 
        "193": "Furthermore, existing transition-based AMR parsers are not general DAG parsers.", 
        "194": "They are only able to predict a subset of reentrancies and discontinuities, as they may remove nodes before their parents have been predicted (Damonte et al., 2017).", 
        "195": "They are thus limited to a sub-class of AMRs in particular, and specifically cannot produce arbitrary DAG parses.", 
        "196": "TUPA\u2019s transition set, on the other hand, allows general DAG parsing.13  7 Conclusion  We present TUPA, the first parser for UCCA.", 
        "197": "Evaluated in in-domain and out-of-domain settings, we show that coupled with a NN classifier and BiLSTM feature extractor, it accurately predicts UCCA graphs from text, outperforming a variety of strong baselines by a margin.",

        "199": "ing work, the effectiveness of different approaches for structurally and semantically different schemes is not well-understood (Kuhlmann and Oepen, 2016).", 
        "200": "Our contribution to this literature is a general parser that supports multiple parents, discontinuous units and non-terminal nodes.", 
        "201": "Future work will evaluate TUPA in a multilingual setting, assessing UCCA\u2019s cross-linguistic applicability.", 
        "202": "We will also apply the TUPA transition scheme to different target representations, including AMR and SDP, exploring the limits of its generality.", 
        "203": "In addition, we will explore different conversion procedures (Kong et al., 2015) to compare different representations, suggesting ways for a data-driven design of semantic annotation.",

        "205": "We believe UCCA\u2019s merits in providing a cross-linguistically applicable, broadcoverage annotation will support ongoing efforts to incorporate deeper semantic structures into various applications, such as sentence simplification (Narayan and Gardent, 2014) and summarization (Liu et al., 2015).",

        "165": "In this scenario, test F1 increased 3.35% (from 67.66 to 71.01%) compared to an increase of 1.06% F1 for a similar comparison with the full training dataset.", 
        "166": "The analogous increases in Yang et al.", 
        "167": "(2017) are 3.97% for cross-lingual transfer from CoNLL 2002 Spanish NER and 6.28% F1 for transfer from PTB POS tags.", 
        "168": "However, they found only a 0.06% F1 increase when using the full training data and transferring from both CoNLL 2000 chunks and PTB POS tags.", 
        "169": "Taken together, this suggests that for very small labeled training sets, transferring from other tasks yields a large improvement, but this improvement almost disappears when the training data is large.", 
        "170": "On the other hand, our approach is less dependent on the training set size and significantly improves performance even with larger training sets.", 
        "171": "Number of parameters.", 
        "172": "Our TagLM formulation increases the number of parameters in the second RNN layer R2 due to the increase in the input dimension h1 if all other hyperparameters are held constant.", 
        "173": "To confirm that this did not have a material impact on the results, we ran two additional experiments.", 
        "174": "In the first, we trained a system without a LM but increased the second RNN layer hidden dimension so that number of parameters was the same as in TagLM.", 
        "175": "In this case, performance decreased slightly (by 0.15% F1) compared to the baseline model, indicating that solely increasing parameters does not improve performance.", 
        "176": "In the second experiment, we decreased the hidden dimension of the second RNN layer in TagLM to give it the same number of parameters as the baseline no LM model.", 
        "177": "In this case, test F1 increased slightly to 92.00 \u00b1 0.11 indicating that the additional parameters in TagLM are slightly hurting\nperformance.4\nDoes the LM transfer across domains?", 
        "178": "One artifact of our evaluation framework is that both the labeled data in the chunking and NER tasks and the unlabeled text in the 1 Billion Word Benchmark used to train the bidirectional LMs are derived from news articles.", 
        "179": "To test the sensitivity to the LM training domain, we also applied TagLM with a LM trained on news articles to the SemEval 2017 Shared Task 10, ScienceIE.5 ScienceIE requires end-to-end joint entity and relationship extraction from scientific publications across three diverse fields (computer science, material sciences, and physics) and defines three broad entity types (Task, Material and Process).", 
        "180": "For this task, TagLM increased F1 on the development set by 4.12% (from 49.93 to to 54.05%) for entity extraction over our baseline without LM embeddings and it was a major component in our winning submission to ScienceIE, Scenario 1 (Ammar et al., 2017).", 
        "181": "We conclude that LM embeddings can improve the performance of a sequence tagger even when the data comes from a different domain.", 
        "182": "4 Related work  Unlabeled data.", 
        "183": "TagLM was inspired by the widespread use of pre-trained word embeddings in supervised sequence tagging models.", 
        "184": "Besides pre-trained word embeddings, our method is most closely related to Li and McCallum (2005).", 
        "185": "Instead of using a LM, Li and McCallum (2005) uses a probabilistic generative model to infer contextsensitive latent variables for each token, which are then used as extra features in a supervised CRF tagger (Lafferty et al., 2001).", 
        "186": "Other semisupervised learning methods for structured prediction problems include co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Pierce and Cardie, 2001), expectation maximization (Nigam et al., 2000; Mohit and Hwa, 2005), structural learning (Ando and Zhang, 2005) and maximum discriminant functions (Suzuki et al., 2007; Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008).", 
        "187": "It is easy to combine TagLM with any of the above methods by including LM embeddings as additional features in the discriminative components of the model (except for expectation maximization).", 
        "188": "A detailed discussion of semisupervised learning methods in NLP can be found\n4A similar experiment for the Chunking task did not improve F1 so this conclusion is task dependent.",

        "192": "LM embeddings are related to a class of methods (e.g., Le and Mikolov, 2014; Kiros et al., 2015; Hill et al., 2016) for learning sentence and document encoders from unlabeled data, which can be used for text classification and textual entailment among other tasks.", 
        "193": "Dai and Le (2015) pre-trained LSTMs using language models and sequence autoencoders then fine tuned the weights for classification tasks.", 
        "194": "In contrast to our method that uses unlabeled data to learn token-in-context embeddings, all of these methods use unlabeled data to learn an encoder for an entire text sequence (sentence or document).", 
        "195": "Neural language models.", 
        "196": "LMs have always been a critical component in statistical machine translation systems (Koehn, 2009).", 
        "197": "Recently, neural LMs (Bengio et al., 2003; Mikolov et al., 2010) have also been integrated in neural machine translation systems (e.g., Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Devlin et al., 2014) to score candidate translations.", 
        "198": "In contrast, TagLM uses neural LMs to encode words in the input sequence.", 
        "199": "Unlike forward LMs, bidirectional LMs have received little prior attention.", 
        "200": "Most similar to our formulation, Peris and Casacuberta (2015) used a bidirectional neural LM in a statistical machine translation system for instance selection.", 
        "201": "They tied the input token embeddings and softmax weights in the forward and backward directions, unlike our approach which uses two distinct models without any shared parameters.",

        "214": "LM embeddings could also be used as additional features in other models, although it is not clear whether the model complexity would be sufficient to effectively make use of them.", 
        "215": "5 Conclusion  In this paper, we proposed a simple and general semi-supervised method using pre-trained neural language models to augment token representations in sequence tagging models.",

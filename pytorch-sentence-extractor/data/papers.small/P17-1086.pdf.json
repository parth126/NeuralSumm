        "71": "When constructing the definition body, users\ncan type utterances with multiple parses; e.g., \u2018move forward\u2019 could either modify the selection (\u2018select front\u2019) or move the voxel (\u2018move front\u2019).", 
        "72": "Rather than propagating this ambiguity to the head, we force the user to commit to one interpretation by selecting a particular candidate.",

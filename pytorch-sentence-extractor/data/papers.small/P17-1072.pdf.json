        "163": "It is not surprising that these two words tend to cooccur in the same news articles, but the usage of islam in the news is increasing while arab is declining.", 
        "164": "The increasing prevalence of islam and decreasing prevalence of arab over this time period can also be seen, for example, using Google\u2019s n-gram viewer, but it of course provides no information about cooccurrence.", 
        "165": "This trend has not been previously noted to the best of our knowledge, although an article in the Huffington Post called for news editors to distinguish Muslim from Arab.6 Our observation suggests a conjecture that the news media have increasingly linked terrorism to a religious group rather than an ethnic group, perhaps in part due to the tie between the events of 9/11 and Afghanistan, which is not an Arab or Arabic-speaking country.", 
        "166": "We leave it to further investigation to confirm or reject this hypothesis.", 
        "167": "To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we compare a pair\u2019s rank using only cooccurrence or prevalence correlation with its rank in our framework.", 
        "168": "Table 1 shows the results for three pairs above.", 
        "169": "If we had looked at only cooccurrence or prevalence correlation, we would probably have missed these interesting pairs.", 
        "170": "6http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ haroon-moghul/even-the-new-york-times-d_ b_766658.html  4.2 Ethnicity Keywords in Immigration  In addition to results on topics in \u00a71, we observe unexpected patterns about ethnicity keywords in immigration news.", 
        "171": "Our observation starts with a top tryst relation between latino and asian.", 
        "172": "Although these words are likely to cooccur, their prevalence trajectories differ, with the discussion of Asian immigrants in the 1990s giving way to a focus on the word latino from 2000 onward.", 
        "173": "Possible theories to explain this observation include that undocumented immigrants are generally perceived as a Latino issue, or that Latino voters are increasingly influential in U.S. elections.", 
        "174": "Furthermore, latino holds head-to-head relations with two subgroups of Latin American immigrants: haitian and cuban.", 
        "175": "In particular, the strength of the relation with haitian is ranked #18 in headto-head relations.", 
        "176": "Meanwhile, haitian and cuban have a friendship relation, which is again consistent with structural balance theory.", 
        "177": "The decreasing prevalence of haitian and cuban perhaps speaks to the shifting geographical focus of recent immigration to the U.S., and issues of the Latino panethnicity.", 
        "178": "In fact, a majority of Latinos prefer to identify with their national origin relative to the\npan-ethnic terms (Taylor et al., 2012).", 
        "179": "However, we should also note that much of this coverage relates to a set of specific refugee crises, temporarily elevating the political importance of these nations in the U.S.", 
        "180": "Nevertheless, the underlying social and political reasons behind these head-to-head relations are worth further investigation.", 
        "181": "4.3 Relations between Topics in ACL  Finally, we analyze relations between topics in the ACL Anthology.", 
        "182": "It turns out that \u201cmachine translation\u201d is at a central position among top ranked relations in all the four types (Fig.", 
        "183": "8).7 It is part of the strongest relation in all four types except tryst (ranked #5).", 
        "184": "The full relation graph presents further patterns.", 
        "185": "Friendship demonstrates transitivity: both \u201cmachine translation\u201d and \u201cword alignment\u201d have similar relations with other topics.", 
        "186": "But such transitivity does not hold for tryst: although the prevalence of \u201crule, forest methods\u201d is anti-correlated with both \u201cmachine translation\u201d and \u201csentiment analysis\u201d, \u201csentiment analysis\u201d seldom cooccurs with \u201crule, for-\n7In the ranking, we filtered a topic where the top words are ion, ing, system, process, language, one, input, natural language, processing, grammar.", 
        "187": "For the purposes of this corpus, this is effectively a stopword topic.", 
        "188": "est methods\u201d because \u201csentiment analysis\u201d is seldom built on parsing algorithms.", 
        "189": "Similarly, \u201crule, forest methods\u201d and \u201cdiscourse (coherence)\u201d hold an armsrace relation: they do not tend to cooccur and both decline in relative prevalence as \u201cmachine translation\u201d rises.", 
        "190": "The prevalence of each of these ideas in comparison to machine translation is shown in in Fig.", 
        "191": "9, which reveals additional detail.", 
        "192": "5 Related Work  We present two strands of related studies in addition to what we have discussed.", 
        "193": "Trends in ideas.", 
        "194": "Most studies have so far examined the trends of ideas individually (Michel et al., 2011; Hall et al., 2008; Rule et al., 2015).", 
        "195": "For instance, Hall et al.", 
        "196": "(2008) present various trends in our own computational linguistics community, including the rise of statistical machine translation.", 
        "197": "More recently, rhetorical framing has been used to predict these sorts of patterns (Prabhakaran et al., 2016).", 
        "198": "An exception is that Shi et al.", 
        "199": "(2010) use prevalence correlation to analyze lag relations between topics in publications and research grants.", 
        "200": "Anecdotally, Grudin (2009) observes a \u201chead-tohead\u201d relation between artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction in research funding.", 
        "201": "However, to our knowledge, our work is the first study to systematically characterize relations between ideas.", 
        "202": "Representation of ideas.", 
        "203": "In addition to topics and keywords, studies have also sought to operationalize the \u201cmemes\u201d metaphor using quotes and text reuse in the media (Leskovec et al., 2009; Niculae et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2013).", 
        "204": "In topic modeling literature, Blei and Lafferty (2006) also point out that topics do not cooccur independently and explicitly model the cooccurrence within documents.", 
        "205": "6 Concluding Discussion  We proposed a method to characterize relations between ideas in texts through the lens of cooccurrence within documents and prevalence correlation over time.", 
        "206": "For the first time, we observe that the distribution of pairwise cooccurrence is unimodal, while the distribution of pairwise prevalence correlation is not always unimodal, and show that they are positively correlated.", 
        "207": "This combination suggests four types of relations between ideas, and these four types are all found to varying extents in our experiments.", 
        "208": "We illustrate our computational method by exploratory studies on news corpora and scientific research papers.", 
        "209": "We not only confirm existing knowledge but also suggest hypotheses around the usage of arab and islam in terrorism and latino and asian in immigration.", 
        "210": "It is important to note that the relations found using our approach depend on the nature of the representation of ideas and the source of texts.", 
        "211": "For instance, we cannot expect relations found in news articles to reflect shifts in public opinion if news articles do not effectively track public opinion.", 
        "212": "Our method is entirely observational.", 
        "213": "It remains as a further stage of analysis to understand the underlying reasons that lead to these relations be-\ntween ideas.", 
        "214": "In scientific research, for example, it could simply be the progress of science, i.e., newer ideas overtake older ones deemed less valuable at a given time; on the other hand, history suggests that it is not always the correct ideas that are most expressed, and many other factors may be important.", 
        "215": "Similarly, in news coverage, underlying sociological and political situations have significant impact on which ideas are presented, and how.", 
        "216": "There are many potential directions to improve our method to account for complex relations between ideas.", 
        "217": "For instance, we assume that both ideas and relations are statically grounded in keywords or topics.", 
        "218": "In reality, ideas and relations both evolve over time: a tryst relation might appear as friendship if we focus on a narrower time period.", 
        "219": "Similarly, new ideas show up and even the same idea may change over time and be represented by different words.", 
        "220": "Acknowledgments.",

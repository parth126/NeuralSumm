        "2": "Determining such a name is a crucial step for referring expression generation (REG) systems, as many other decisions concerning, e.g., the selection of attributes follow from it (Dale and Reiter, 1995; Krahmer and Van Deemter, 2012).", 
        "3": "For a long time, however, research on REG mostly assumed the availability of symbolic representations of ref-\nerent and scene, and sidestepped questions about how speakers actually choose these names, due to the lack of models capable of capturing what a word like house refers to in the real world.", 
        "4": "Recent advances in image processing promise to fill this gap, with state-of-the-art computer vision systems being able to classify images into thousands of different categories (e.g.", 
        "5": "Szegedy et al.",

        "10": "Figure 1 (a) as either house or building, ignoring the lexical similarity between these two names.",

        "12": "Depending on the prototypicality of the object to name, and possibly other visual properties, a general name might be more or less appropriate.", 
        "13": "For instance, a robin can be named bird, but a penguin is better referred\n243\nto as \u201cpenguin\u201d (Rosch, 1978); along the same lines, the rather unusual building in Figure 1 (c) that is not easy to otherwise categorise was named \u201cstructure\u201d.",

        "17": "Thus, under the assumption that such semantic spaces represent, in some form at least, taxonomic knowledge, this makes labels on different levels of specificity available for a given object.", 
        "18": "Moreover, if the mapping is sufficiently general, it should be able to map objects to an appropriate label, even if during training of the mapping this label has not been seen (zero-shot learning).", 
        "19": "While cross-modal transfer seems to be a conceptually attractive model for learning object names, it is based on an important assumption that, in our view, has not received sufficient attention in previous works: it assumes that a given distributional vector space constitutes an optimal target representation that visual instances of objects can be mapped to.",

        "33": "Whereas Roy\u2019s work still looked at relatively simple scenes with graphical objects, research on REG has recently started to investigate set-ups based on real-world images (Kazemzadeh et al., 2014; Gkatzia et al., 2015; Zarrie\u00df and Schlangen, 2016; Mao et al., 2015).", 
        "34": "Importantly, the lowlevel visual features that can be extracted from these scenes correspond less directly to particular word classes.",

        "146": "Results Table 2 shows that all model combinations improve over the results of their isolated models in Table 1, suggesting that WAC, TRANSFER and SIM-WAP indeed do capture complementary aspects of referential word meaning.", 
        "147": "On their own, the distributionally informed models are less tuned to specific word occurrences than the visual word classifiers in the WAC model, but they can add useful information which leads to a clear overall improvement.",

        "151": "Word Similarities Many of the examples in Figure 2 suggest that the object names ranked among the top 3 by the TRANSFER and SIMWAP model are semantically similar to each other, whereas WAC generates object names on top that describe very different underlying object categories, such as seal / rock in Figure 2(a), animal / lamp in Figure 2(g) or chair / shirt in Figure 2(c).",

        "161": "Zarrie\u00df and Schlangen (2016)), would be an interesting direction for more detailed investigation here.", 
        "162": "Word Use But even though the WAC classifiers lack knowledge on lexical similarities, they seem to able to detect relatively specific instances of word use such as hut in Figure 2(b), shirt in 2(c) or lamp in 2(h).", 
        "163": "Here, the combination with TRANSFER and SIM-WAP is helpful to give more weight to the object name that is taxonomically correct (sometimes pushing up words below the top-3 and hence not shown in Figure 2).", 
        "164": "In Figure 1(e), SIMWAP and TRANSFER give more weight to typical names for persons, whereas WAC top-ranks more unusual names, reflecting that the person is difficult to identify visually.", 
        "165": "Another observation is that the mapping models have difficulties dealing with object names in singular and plural.", 
        "166": "As these words have very similar representations in the distributional space, they are often predicted as likely variants among the top 10 by SIM-WAP and TRANSFER, whereas the WAC model seems to predict inappropriate plural words less often among the top 3.", 
        "167": "Such specific phenomena at the intersection of visual and semantic similarity have found very little attention in the literature.", 
        "168": "We will investigate them further in our Experiments on zeroshot naming in the following Section.", 
        "169": "6 Zero-Shot Naming  Zero-shot learning is an attractive prospect for REG from images, as it promises to overcome dependence on pairings of visual instances and natural names being available for all names, if visual/referential data can be generalised from other types of information.", 
        "170": "Previous work has looked at the feasibility of zero-shot learning as a function of semantic similarity or ontological closeness between unknown and known categories, and confirmed the intuition that the task is harder the less close unknown categories are to known ones (Frome et al., 2013; Norouzi et al., 2013).", 
        "171": "Our experiments on object naming in Section 5 suggest that lexical similarities encoded in a distributional space might not always fully carry over to referential meaning.", 
        "172": "This could constitute an additional challenge for zero-shot learning, as distributional similarities might be misleading when\nthe model has to fully rely on them for learning referential word meanings.", 
        "173": "Therefore, the following experiments investigate the performance of our models in zero-shot naming as a function of the lexical relation between unknown and known object names, i.e.", 
        "174": "namely hypernyms and singular/plurals.", 
        "175": "Both relations are typically captured by distributional models of word meaning in terms of closeness in the vector space, but their visual and referential relation is clearly different.", 
        "176": "6.1 Vocabulary Splits and Testsets  Random As in previous work on zero-shot learning, we consider zero-shot naming for words of varying degrees of similarity.", 
        "177": "We randomly split our 159 names from Experiment 1 into 10 subsets.", 
        "178": "We train the models on 90% of the nouns (and all their visual instances in the image corpus) and test on the set of image regions that are named with words which the model did not observe during training.", 
        "179": "Results reported in Table 4 on the random test set correspond to averaged scores from cross-validation over the 10 splits.", 
        "180": "Hypernyms We manually split the model\u2019s vocabulary into set of hypernyms (see Appendix A) and the remaining nouns.", 
        "181": "We train the models on those 84K image regions that where not named with a hypernym, and test on 8895 image regions that were named with a hypernym in the corpus.", 
        "182": "We checked that for each of these hypernyms, the vocabulary contains at least one or two names that can be considered as hyponyms, i.e.", 
        "183": "the model sees objects during training that are instances of vehicle for example, but never encounters actual uses of that name.", 
        "184": "This test set is particularly interesting from an REG perspective, as objects named with very general terms by human speakers are often difficult to describe with more common, but more specific terms, as is illustrated by the uses of structure and thingy in Figure 1.", 
        "185": "Singulars/Plurals We pick 68 words from our vocabulary that can be grouped into 34 singularplural noun pairs (see Appendix A).", 
        "186": "From each pair, we randomly include the singular or plural noun in the set of zero-shot nouns.", 
        "187": "Thus, we make sure that the model encounters singular and plural names during training, but it never encounters both variants of a name.", 
        "188": "This results training split of 23K image regions and a test split of 13825 instances.", 
        "189": "6.2 Evaluation  Some previous work on zero-shot image labeling assumes additional components that first identify whether an image should be labelled by a known or unknown word (Frome et al., 2013).", 
        "190": "We follow Lazaridou et al.", 
        "191": "(2014) and let the model decide whether to refer to an object by a known or unknown name.", 
        "192": "Related to that, distinct evaluation procedures have been used in the literature on zero-shot learning:\nTesting on full vocabulary A realistic way to test zero-shot learning performance is to consider all words from a given vocabulary during testing, though the testset only contains instances of objects that have been named with a \u2018zero-shot word\u2019 (for which no visual instances were seen during training).", 
        "193": "Accuracies in this setup reflect how well the model is able to generalize, i.e.", 
        "194": "how often it decides to deviate from the words it was trained on, and (implicitly) predicts that the given object requires a \u201cnew\u201d name.", 
        "195": "In case of the (i) hypernym and (ii) singular/plural test set, this accuracy also reflects to what extent the model is able to detect cases where (i) a more general or vague term is needed, where (ii) an unknown singular/plural counterpart of a known object type occurs.", 
        "196": "Testing on disjoint vocabulary Alternatively, the model\u2019s vocabulary can be restricted during testing to zero-shot words only, such that names encountered during training and testing are disjoint, see e.g.", 
        "197": "(Lampert et al., 2009, 2013).", 
        "198": "This setup factors out the generalization problem, and assesses to what extent a model is able to capture the referential meaning of a word that does not have instances in the training data.", 
        "199": "6.3 Results  As compared to Experiment 1 where models achieved similar performance, differences are more pronounced in the zero-shot setup, as shown in Table 4.", 
        "200": "In particular, we find that the SIMWAP model which induces individual predictors for words that have not been observed in the training data is clearly more successful than TRANSFER or WAC that project predictions into the distributional space.", 
        "201": "When tested on the full vocabulary, we find that TRANSFER and WAC very rarely generate names whose referents were excluded from training, which is in line with observations made by Lazaridou et al.", 
        "202": "(2015a).", 
        "203": "The SIM-WAP\npredictors generalize much better, in particular on the singular/plural testset.", 
        "204": "An interesting exception is the good performance of the TRANSFER model on the hypernym test set, when evaluated with a disjoint vocabulary.", 
        "205": "This corroborates evidence from Experiment 1, namely that the transfer model captures taxonomic aspects of object names better than the other models.", 
        "206": "Projection via individual word classifiers, on the other hand, seems to generalize better than TRANSFER, at least when looking at accuracies @2 ... @10.", 
        "207": "Thus, combining several vectors predicted by a model of referential word meaning can provide additional information, as compared to mapping an object to a single vector in distributional space.", 
        "208": "More work is needed to establish how these approaches can be integrated more effectively.", 
        "209": "7 Discussion and Conclusion  In this paper, we have investigated models of referential word meaning, using different ways of combining visual information about a word\u2019s referent and distributional knowledge about its lexical similarities.", 
        "210": "Previous cross-modal mapping models essentially force semantically similar objects to be mapped into the same area in the semantic space regardless of their actual visual similarity.", 
        "211": "We found that cross-modal mapping produces semantically appropriate and mutually highly similar object names in its top-n list, but does not preserve differences in referential word use (e.g.", 
        "212": "appropriatness of person vs. woman) especially within the same semantic field.", 
        "213": "We have shown that it is beneficial for performance in standard and zeroshot object naming to treat words as individual predictors that capture referential appropriateness and are only indirectly linked to a distributional space, either through lexical mapping during application or through cross-modal similarity mapping during training.", 
        "214": "As we have tested these approaches on a rather small vocabulary, which may limit generality of conclusions, future work will be devoted to scaling up these findings to larger test sets, as e.g.", 
        "215": "recently collected through conversational agents (Das et al., 2016) that circumvent the need for human-human interaction data.", 
        "216": "Also from an REG perspective, various extensions of this approach are possible, such as the inclusion of contextual information during object naming and its combination with attribute selection.",

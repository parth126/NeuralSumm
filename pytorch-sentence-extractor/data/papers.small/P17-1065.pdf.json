        "132": "The SD-NMT model significantly outperforms most other NMT models, which shows that our proposed approach to modeling target dependency tree benefit NMT systems since our RNNsearch baseline achieves comparable performance with the single layer attention-based NMT system in (Cromieres, 2016).", 
        "133": "Note that our SD-NMT gets comparable results with the 4 single-layer ensemble model in (Cromieres, 2016; Cromieres et al., 2016).",

        "144": "4.5 Quality Estimation of Dependency Tree Construction  As a by-product, the quality of dependency trees not only affects the performance of target word generation, but also influences the possible downstream processors or tasks such as text analyses.", 
        "145": "The direct evaluation of tree quality is not feasible due to the unavailable golden references.", 
        "146": "So we resort to estimating the consistency between the by-products and the parsing results of our standalone dependency parser with state-of-the-art performance.", 
        "147": "The higher the consistency is, the closer the performance of by-product is to the standalone parser.", 
        "148": "To reduce the influence of ill-formed data as much as possible, we build the evaluation data set by heuristically selecting 360 SD-NMT translation results together with their dependency trees from NIST test sets where both source- and target-side do not contain unk and have a length of 20-30.", 
        "149": "We then take the parsing results of the stand-alone parser for these translations as references to indirectly estimate the quality of byproducts.", 
        "150": "We get a UAS (unlabeled attachment score) of 94.96% and a LAS (labeled attachment score) of 93.92%, which demonstrates that the dependency trees produced by SD-NMT are much similar with the parsing results from the standalone parser.",

        "156": "Although the translation of RNNsearch is locally fluent around word \u201chave\u201d in the rectangle, both its grammar is incorrect and its meaning is inaccurate from a global view.", 
        "157": "The word \u201chave\u201d should be in a singular form as its subject is \u201csafety\u201d rather than \u201cworkers\u201d.", 
        "158": "For our SD-NMT model, we can see that the translation is much better than baselines and the dependency tree is reasonable.", 
        "159": "The reason is that after generating the word \u201cworkers\u201d, the previous subtree in the gray region is transformed to the syntactic context which can guide the generation of the next word as illustrated by the dashed arrow.", 
        "160": "Thus our model is more likely to generate the correct verb \u201cis\u201d with singular form.", 
        "161": "In addition, the global structure helps the model correctly identify the inverted sentence pattern of the former translated part and make better choices for the future translation (\u201conly when .. can ..\u201d in our translation, \u201conly when .. will ..\u201d in the reference), which remains a challenge for conventional NMT model.",

Another advantage of kgCVAE is that it can output a highlevel label (e.g.",

        "154": "As for precision, we observed that the baseline has higher or similar scores than CVAE in all metrics, which is expected since the baseline tends to generate the mostly likely and safe responses repeatedly in the N hypotheses.", 
        "155": "However, kgCVAE is able to achieve the highest precision and recall in the 4 metrics at the same time (BLEU1-4, E-BOW).", 
        "156": "One reason\nfor kgCVAE\u2019s good performance is that the predicted dialog act label in kgCVAE can regularize the generation process of its RNN decoder by forcing it to generate more coherent and precise words.", 
        "157": "We further analyze the precision/recall of BLEU4 by looking at the average score versus the number of distinct reference dialog acts.", 
        "158": "A low number of distinct dialog acts represents the situation where the dialog context has a strong constraint on the range of the next response (low entropy), while a high number indicates the opposite (highentropy).", 
        "159": "Figure 4 shows that CVAE/kgCVAE achieves significantly higher recall than the baseline in higher entropy contexts.", 
        "160": "Also it shows that CVAE suffers from lower precision, especially in low entropy contexts.", 
        "161": "Finally, kgCVAE gets higher precision than both the baseline and CVAE in the full spectrum of context entropy.", 
        "162": "5.3 Qualitative Analysis  Table 2 shows the outputs generated from the baseline and kgCVAE.", 
        "163": "In example 1, caller A begins with an open-ended question.", 
        "164": "The kgCVAE model generated highly diverse answers that cover multiple plausible dialog acts.", 
        "165": "Further, we notice that the generated text exhibits similar dialog acts compared to the ones predicted separately by the model, implying the consistency of natural language generation based on y.", 
        "166": "On the contrary, the responses from the baseline model are limited to local n-gram variations and share a similar prefix, i.e.", 
        "167": "\u201dI\u2019m\u201d.", 
        "168": "Example 2 is a situation where caller A is telling B stories.", 
        "169": "The ground truth response is a back-channel and the range of valid answers is more constrained than example 1 since B is playing the role of a listener.", 
        "170": "The baseline successfully predicts \u201duh-huh\u201d.", 
        "171": "The kgCVAE model is also able to generate various ways of back-channeling.", 
        "172": "This implies that the latent z is able to capture context-sensitive variations, i.e.", 
        "173": "in low-entropy dialog contexts modeling lexical diversity while in high-entropy ones modeling discourse-level diversity.", 
        "174": "Moreover, kgCVAE is occasionally able to\ngenerate more sophisticated grounding (sample 4) beyond a simple back-channel, which is also an acceptable response given the dialog context.", 
        "175": "In addition, past work (Kingma and Welling, 2013) has shown that the recognition network is able to learn to cluster high-dimension data, so we conjecture that posterior z outputted from the recognition network should cluster the responses into meaningful groups.", 
        "176": "Figure 5 visualizes the posterior z of responses in the test dataset in 2D space using t-SNE (Maaten and Hinton, 2008).", 
        "177": "We found that the learned latent space is highly correlated with the dialog act and length of responses, which confirms our assumption.", 
        "178": "5.4 Results for Bag-of-Word Loss  Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of bag-ofword (BOW) loss for training VAE/CVAE with the RNN decoder.", 
        "179": "To compare with past work (Bowman et al., 2015), we conducted the same language modelling (LM) task on Penn Treebank using VAE.", 
        "180": "The network architecture is same except we use GRU instead of LSTM.", 
        "181": "We compared four different training setups: (1) standard VAE without any heuristics; (2) VAE with KL annealing (KLA); (3) VAE with BOW loss; (4) VAE with both BOW loss and KLA.", 
        "182": "Intuitively, a well trained model should lead to a low reconstruction loss and small but non-trivial KL cost.", 
        "183": "For all models with KLA, the KL weight increases linearly from 0 to 1 in the first 5000 batches.", 
        "184": "Table 3 shows the reconstruction perplexity and the KL cost on the test dataset.", 
        "185": "The standard VAE fails to learn a meaningful latent variable by hav-\ning a KL cost close to 0 and a reconstruction perplexity similar to a small LSTM LM (Zaremba et al., 2014).", 
        "186": "KLA helps to improve the reconstruction loss, but it requires early stopping since the models will fall back to the standard VAE after the KL weight becomes 1.", 
        "187": "At last, the models with BOW loss achieved significantly lower perplexity and larger KL cost.", 
        "188": "Figure 6 visualizes the evolution of the KL cost.", 
        "189": "We can see that for the standard model, the KL cost crashes to 0 at the beginning of training and never recovers.", 
        "190": "On the contrary, the model with only KLA learns to encode substantial information in latent z when the KL cost weight is small.", 
        "191": "However, after the KL weight is increased to 1 (after 5000 batch), the model once again decides to ignore the latent z and falls back to the naive implementation.", 
        "192": "The model with BOW loss, however, consistently converges to a non-trivial KL cost even without KLA, which confirms the importance of BOW loss for training latent variable models with the RNN decoder.", 
        "193": "Last but not least, our experiments showed that the conclusions drawn from LM using VAE also apply to training CVAE/kgCVAE, so we used BOW loss together with KLA for all previous experiments.", 
        "194": "6 Conclusion and Future Work  In conclusion, we identified the one-to-many nature of open-domain conversation and proposed two novel models that show superior performance in generating diverse and appropriate responses at the discourse level.", 
        "195": "While the current paper addresses diversifying responses in respect to dialogue acts, this work is part of a larger research direction that targets leveraging both past linguistic findings and the learning power of deep neural networks to learn better representation of the latent factors in dialog.", 
        "196": "In turn, the output of this novel neural dialog model will be easier to explain and control by humans.", 
        "197": "In addition to dialog acts, we plan to apply our kgCVAE model to capture other different linguistic phenomena including sentiment, named entities,etc.", 
        "198": "Last but not least, the recognition network in our model will serve as the foundation for designing a datadriven dialog manager, which automatically discovers useful high-level intents.", 
        "199": "All of the above suggest a promising research direction.", 
        "200": "A Supplemental Material  Variational Lower Bound for kgCVAE We assume that even with the presence of linguistic feature y regarding x, the prediction of xbow still only depends on the z and c. Therefore, we have:\nL(\u03b8, \u03c6;x, c, y) = \u2212KL(q\u03c6(z|x, c, y)\u2016P\u03b8(z|c)) +Eq\u03c6(z|c,x,y)[log p(x|z, c, y)] +Eq\u03c6(z|c,x,y)[log p(y|z, c)] +Eq\u03c6(z|c,x,y)[log p(xbow|z, c)]\n(7)\nCollection of Multiple Reference Responses We collected multiple reference responses for each dialog context in the test set by information retrieval techniques combining with traditional a machine learning method.", 
        "201": "First, we encode the dialog history using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) (Salton and Buckley, 1988) weighted bag-of-words into vector representation h. Then we denote the topic of the conversation as t and denote f as the conversation floor, i.e.", 
        "202": "if the speakers of the last utterance in the dialog history and response utterance are the same f = 1 otherwise f = 0.", 
        "203": "Then we computed the similarity d(ci, cj) between two dialog contexts using:\nd(ci, cj) = 1(ti = tj)1(ti = tj) hi \u00b7 hj ||hi||||hj || (8)\nUnlike past work (Sordoni et al., 2015), this similarity function only cares about the distance in the context and imposes no constraints on the response, therefore is suitbale for finding diverse responses regarding to the same dialog context.", 
        "204": "Secondly, for each dialog context in the test set, we retrieved the 10 nearest neighbors from the training set and treated the responses from the training set as candidate reference responses.", 
        "205": "Thirdly, we further sampled 240 context-responses pairs from 5481 pairs in the total test set and post-processed the selected candidate responses by two human computational linguistic experts who were told to give a binary label for each candidate response about whether the response is appropriate regarding its dialog context.", 
        "206": "The filtered lists then served as the ground truth to train our reference response classifier.", 
        "207": "For the next step, we extracted bigrams, part-of-speech bigrams and word part-of-speech\npairs from both dialogue contexts and candidate reference responses with rare threshold for feature extraction being set to 20.", 
        "208": "Then L2-regularized logistic regression with 10-fold cross validation was applied as the machine learning algorithm.", 
        "209": "Cross validation accuracy on the human-labelled data was 71%.", 
        "210": "Finally, we automatically annotated the rest of test set with this trained classifier and the resulting data were used for model evaluation."

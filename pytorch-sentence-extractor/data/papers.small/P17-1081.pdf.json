        "2": "Sentiment analysis can be performed at different granularity levels, e.g., subjectivity detection simply classifies data as either subjective (opinionated) or objective (neutral), while polarity detection focuses on determining whether subjective data indicate positive or negative sentiment.", 
        "3": "Emotion recognition further breaks down the inferred polarity into a set of emotions conveyed by the subjective data, e.g., positive sentiment can be caused by joy or anticipation, while negative sentiment can be caused by fear or disgust.", 
        "4": "Even though the primary focus of this paper is to classify sentiment in videos, we also show the performance of the proposed method for the finergrained task of emotion recognition.", 
        "5": "Emotion recognition and sentiment analysis have become a new trend in social media, helping users and companies to automatically extract the opinions expressed in user-generated content, especially videos.", 
        "6": "Thanks to the high availability of computers and smartphones, and the rapid rise of social media, consumers tend to record their reviews and opinions about products or films and upload them on social media platforms, such as YouTube and Facebook.", 
        "7": "Such videos often contain comparisons, which can aid prospective buyers make an informed decision.", 
        "8": "The primary advantage of analyzing videos over text is the surplus of behavioral cues present in vocal and visual modalities.", 
        "9": "The vocal modulations and facial expressions in the visual data, along with textual data, provide important cues to better identify affective states of the opinion holder.", 
        "10": "Thus, a combination of text and video data helps to create a more robust emotion and sentiment analysis model (Poria et al., 2017a).", 
        "11": "An utterance (Olson, 1977) is a unit of speech bound by breathes or pauses.", 
        "12": "Utterance-level sentiment analysis focuses on tagging every utterance of a video with a sentiment label (instead of assigning a unique label to the whole video).", 
        "13": "In particular, utterance-level sentiment analysis is useful to understand the sentiment dynamics of different aspects of the topics covered by the speaker throughout his/her speech.", 
        "14": "Recently, a number of approaches to multimodal sentiment analysis, producing interesting results, have been proposed (Pe\u0301rez-Rosas et al., 2013; Wollmer et al., 2013; Poria et al., 2015).", 
        "15": "However, there are major issues that remain unaddressed.", 
        "16": "Not considering the relation and dependencies among the utterances is one of such issues.", 
        "17": "State-of-the-art approaches in this area treat utterances independently and ignore the order of utterances in a video (Cambria et al., 2017b).", 
        "18": "873\nEvery utterance in a video is spoken at a distinct time and in a particular order.", 
        "19": "Thus, a video can be treated as a sequence of utterances.", 
        "20": "Like any other sequence classification problem (Collobert et al., 2011), sequential utterances of a video may largely be contextually correlated and, hence, influence each other\u2019s sentiment distribution.", 
        "21": "In our paper, we give importance to the order in which utterances appear in a video.", 
        "22": "We treat surrounding utterances as the context of the utterance that is aimed to be classified.", 
        "23": "For example, the MOSI dataset (Zadeh et al., 2016) contains a video, in which a girl reviews the movie \u2018Green Hornet\u2019.",

        "27": "The hypothesis of the independence of tokens is quite popular in information retrieval and data mining, e.g., bag-of-words model, but it has a lot limitations (Cambria and White, 2014).", 
        "28": "In this paper, we discard such an oversimplifying hypothesis and develop a framework based on long shortterm memory (LSTM) that takes a sequence of utterances as input and extracts contextual utterancelevel features.", 
        "29": "The other uncovered major issues in the literature are the role of speaker-dependent versus speaker-independent models, the impact of each modality across the dataset, and generalization ability of a multimodal sentiment classifier.", 
        "30": "Leaving these issues unaddressed has presented difficulties in effective comparison of different multimodal sentiment analysis methods.", 
        "31": "In this work, we address all of these issues.", 
        "32": "Our model preserves the sequential order of utterances and enables consecutive utterances to share information, thus providing contextual information to the utterance-level sentiment classification process.", 
        "33": "Experimental results show that the proposed framework has outperformed the state of the art on three benchmark datasets by 5-10%.", 
        "34": "The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief literature review on multimodal sentiment analysis; Section 3 describes the proposed method in detail; experimental results and discussion are shown in Section 4; finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.", 
        "35": "2 Related Work  The opportunity to capture people\u2019s opinions has raised growing interest both within the scientific community, for the new research challenges, and in the business world, due to the remarkable benefits to be had from financial market prediction.",

        "37": "While the use of knowledge bases was initially more popular for the identification of polarity in text (Cambria et al., 2016; Poria et al., 2016c), sentiment analysis researchers have recently been using statistics-based approaches, with a special focus on supervised statistical methods (Socher et al., 2013; Oneto et al., 2016).",

        "59": "3.1.1 text-CNN: Textual Features Extraction  The source of textual modality is the transcription of the spoken words.", 
        "60": "For extracting features from the textual modality, we use a CNN (Karpathy et al., 2014).", 
        "61": "In particular, we first represent each utterance as the concatenation of vectors of the constituent words.", 
        "62": "These vectors are the publicly available 300-dimensional word2vec vectors trained on 100 billion words from Google News (Mikolov et al., 2013).", 
        "63": "The convolution kernels are thus applied to these concatenated word vectors instead of individual words.", 
        "64": "Each utterance is wrapped to a window of 50 words which serves as the input to the CNN.", 
        "65": "The CNN has two convolutional layers; the first layer has two kernels of size 3 and 4, with 50 feature maps each and the second layer has a kernel of size 2 with 100 feature maps.", 
        "66": "The convolution layers are interleaved with max-pooling layers of window 2 \u00d7 2.",

        "185": "The usefulness of the dense layer in increasing the performance is evident from the experimental results shown in Table 3.", 
        "186": "The performance improvement is in the range of 0.3% to 1.5% on MOSI and MOUD datasets.", 
        "187": "On the IEMOCAP dataset, the performance improvement of bc-LSTM and sc-LSTM over h-LSTM is in the range of 1% to 5%.",

        "189": "These results prove our initial hypothesis that modeling the contextual dependencies among utterances (which uniSVM cannot do) improves the classification.", 
        "190": "The higher performance improvement on the IEMOCAP dataset indicates the necessity of modeling long-range dependencies among the utterances as continuous emotion recognition is a multiclass sequential problem where a person does not frequently change emotions (Wo\u0308llmer et al., 2008).", 
        "191": "We have implemented and compared with the current state-of-the-art approach proposed by (Poria et al., 2015).", 
        "192": "In their method, they extracted features from each modality and fed these to a MKL classifier.",

        "197": "4.3 Importance of the Modalities  As expected, in all kinds of experiments, bimodal and trimodal models have outperformed unimodal models.",

        "202": "However, the margin is less in the other datasets.", 
        "203": "On the MOUD dataset, the textual modality performs worse than audio modality due to the noise introduced in translating Spanish utterances to English.", 
        "204": "Using Spanish word vectors3 in text-CNN results in an improvement of 10%.", 
        "205": "Nonetheless, we report results using these translated utterances as opposed to utterances trained on Spanish word vectors, in order to make fair comparison with (Poria et al., 2015).", 
        "206": "4.4 Generalization of the Models  To test the generalizability of the models, we have trained our framework on complete MOSI dataset and tested on MOUD dataset (Table 5).", 
        "207": "The performance was poor for audio and textual modality as the MOUD dataset is in Spanish while the model is trained on MOSI dataset, which is in English language.", 
        "208": "However, notably the visual modality performs better than the other two modalities in this experiment, which means that in cross-lingual scenarios facial expressions carry more generalized, robust information than audio and textual modalities.", 
        "209": "We could not carry out a similar experiment for emotion recognition as no other utterance-level dataset apart from the IEMOCAP was available at the time of our experiments.", 
        "210": "4.5 Qualitative Analysis  The need for considering context dependency (see Section 1) is of prime importance for utterancelevel sentiment classification.", 
        "211": "For example, in the utterance \u201cWhat would have been a better name for the movie\u201d, the speaker is attempting to comment the quality of the movie by giving an appropriate name.", 
        "212": "However, the sentiment is expressed implicitly and requires the contextual knowledge about the mood of the speaker and his/her general opinion about the film.", 
        "213": "The baseline unimodalSVM and state of the art fail to classify this utterance correctly4.", 
        "214": "3http://crscardellino.me/SBWCE 4RNTN classifies it as neutral.", 
        "215": "It can be seen here\nhttp://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/sentiment/rntnDemo.html\nHowever, information from neighboring utterances, e.g., \u201cAnd I really enjoyed it\u201d and \u201cThe countryside which they showed while going through Ireland was astoundingly beautiful\u201d indicate its positive context and help our contextual model to classify the target utterance correctly.", 
        "216": "Such contextual relationships are prevalent throughout the dataset.", 
        "217": "In order to have a better understanding of the roles of each modality for the overall classification, we have also done some qualitative analysis.", 
        "218": "For example, the utterance \u201cwho doesn\u2019t have\nany presence or greatness at all\u201d was classified as positive by the audio classifier (as \u201cpresence and greatness at all\u201d was spoken with enthusiasm).", 
        "219": "However, the textual modality caught the negation induced by \u201cdoesn\u2019t\u201d and classified it correctly.", 
        "220": "The same happened to the utterance \u201camazing special effects\u201d, which presented no jest of enthusiasm in the speaker\u2019s voice nor face, but was correctly classified by the textual classifier.", 
        "221": "On other hand, the textual classifier classified the utterance \u201cthat like to see comic book characters treated responsibly\u201d as positive (for the presence of \u201clike to see\u201d and \u201cresponsibly\u201d) but the high pitch of anger in the person\u2019s voice and the frowning face helps to identify this as a negative utterance.", 
        "222": "In some cases, the predictions of the proposed method are wrong because of face occlusion or noisy audio.", 
        "223": "Also, in cases where sentiment is very weak and non contextual, the proposed approach shows some bias towards its surrounding utterances, which further leads to wrong predictions.", 
        "224": "5 Conclusion  The contextual relationship among utterances in a video is mostly ignored in the literature.", 
        "225": "In this paper, we developed a LSTM-based network to extract contextual features from the utterances of a video for multimodal sentiment analysis.", 
        "226": "The proposed method has outperformed the state of the art and showed significant performance improvement over the baseline.", 
        "227": "As future work, we plan to develop a LSTMbased attention model to determine the importance of each utterance and its specific contribution to each modality for sentiment classification."

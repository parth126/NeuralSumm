        "157": "We also outperform several previous systems, including the very deep encoder-decoder model proposed by (Luong et al., 2015a).", 
        "158": "Our best result is just 0.2 BLEU below (Zhou et al., 2016) who use a very deep LSTM setup with a 9-layer encoder, a 7-layer decoder, shortcut connections and extensive regularization with dropout and L2 regularization.", 
        "159": "5.3 Convolutional Encoder Architecture Details  We next motivate our design of the convolutional encoder (\u00a73.2).", 
        "160": "We use the smaller IWSLT\u201914 German-English setup without unknown word replacement to enable fast experimental turn-around.", 
        "161": "BLEU results are averaged over three training runs initialized with different seeds.", 
        "162": "Figure 2 shows accuracy for a different number of layers of both CNNs with and without residual connections.", 
        "163": "Our first observation is that computing the conditional input ci directly over embeddings e (line \u201dwithout CNN-c\u201d) is already working well at 28.3 BLEU with a single CNN-a layer and at 29.1 BLEU for CNN-a with 7 layers (Figure 2a).", 
        "164": "Increasing the number of CNN-c layers is beneficial up to three layers and beyond this we did not observe further improvements.", 
        "165": "Similarly, increasing the number of layers in CNN-a beyond six does not increase accuracy on this relatively small dataset.", 
        "166": "In general, choosing two to three times as many layers in CNN-a as in CNN-c is a good rule of thumb.", 
        "167": "Without residual connections, the model fails to utilize the increase in modeling power from additional layers, and performance drops significantly for deeper encoders (Figure 2b).", 
        "168": "Our convolutional architecture relies on two sets of networks, CNN-a for attention score computation ai and CNN-c for the conditional input ci to be fed to the decoder.", 
        "169": "We found that using the same network for both tasks, similar to recurrent encoders, resulted in poor accuracy of 22.9 BLEU.", 
        "170": "This compares to 28.5 BLEU for separate singlelayer networks, or 28.3 BLEU when aggregating embeddings for ci.", 
        "171": "Increasing the number of layers in the single network setup did not help.", 
        "172": "Figure 2(a) suggests that the attention weights (CNN-a) need to integrate information from a wide context which can be done with a deep stack.", 
        "173": "At the same time, the vectors which are averaged (CNN-c) seem to benefit from a shallower, more local representation closer to the input words.", 
        "174": "Two stacks are an easy way to achieve these contradicting requirements.", 
        "175": "In Appendix A we visualize attention scores and find that alignments for CNN encoders are less sharp compared to BiLSTMs, however, this does not affect the effectiveness of unknown word replacement once we adjust for shifted maxima.", 
        "176": "In Appendix B we investigate whether deep convolutional encoders are required for translating long sentences and observe that even relatively shallow encoders perform well on long sentences.", 
        "177": "5.4 Training and Generation Speed  For training, we use the fast CuDNN LSTM implementation for layers without attention and experiment on IWSLT\u201914 with batch size 32.", 
        "178": "The single-layer BiLSTM model trains at 4300 target words/second, while the 6/3 deep convolutional encoder compares at 6400 words/second on an NVidia Tesla M40 GPU.", 
        "179": "We do not observe shorter overall training time since SGD converges slower than Adam which we use for BiLSTM models.", 
        "180": "We measure generation speed on an Intel Haswell CPU clocked at 2.50GHz with a single thread for BLAS operations.", 
        "181": "We use vocabulary selection which can speed up generation by up to a factor of ten at no cost in accuracy via making the time to compute the final output layer negligible (Mi et al., 2016; L\u2019Hostis et al., 2016).", 
        "182": "This shifts the focus from the efficiency of the encoder to the efficiency of the decoder.", 
        "183": "On IWSLT\u201914 (Table 3a) the convolutional encoder increases the speed of the overall model by a factor of 1.35 compared to the BiLSTM encoder while improving accuracy by 0.7 BLEU.", 
        "184": "In this setup both encoders models have the same hidden layer and embedding sizes.", 
        "185": "On the larger WMT\u201915 English-German task (Table 3b) the convolutional encoder speeds up generation by 2.1 times compared to a two-layer BiLSTM.", 
        "186": "This corresponds to 231 source words/second with beam size 5.", 
        "187": "Our best model on this dataset generates 203 words/second but at slightly lower accuracy compared to the full vocabulary setting in Table 2.", 
        "188": "The recurrent encoder uses larger embeddings than the convolutional encoder which were required for the models to match in accuracy.", 
        "189": "The smaller embedding size is not the only reason for the speed-up.", 
        "190": "In Table 3a (a), we compare a Conv 6/3 encoder and a BiLSTM with equal embedding sizes.", 
        "191": "The convolutional encoder is still 1.34x faster (at 0.7 higher BLEU) although it requires roughly 1.6x as many FLOPs.", 
        "192": "We believe that this is likely due to better cache locality for convolutional layers on CPUs: an LSTM with fused gates7 requires two big matrix multiplications with different weights as well as additions, multiplications and non-linearities for each source word, while the output of each convolutional layer can be computed as whole with a single matrix multiply.", 
        "193": "For comparison, the quantized deep LSTM7Our bi-directional LSTM implementation is based on torch rnnlib which uses fused LSTM gates (https://github.com/facebookresearch/ torch-rnnlib/) and which we consider an efficient implementation.", 
        "194": "based model in (Wu et al., 2016) processes 106.4 words/second for English-French on a CPU with 88 cores and 358.8 words/second on a custom TPU chip.", 
        "195": "The optimized RNNsearch model and C++ decoder described by (Junczys-Dowmunt et al., 2016) translates 265.3 words/s on a CPU with a similar vocabulary selection technique, computing 16 sentences in parallel, i.e., 16.6 words/s on a single core.", 
        "196": "6 Conclusion  We introduced a simple encoder model for neural machine translation based on convolutional networks.", 
        "197": "This approach is more parallelizable than recurrent networks and provides a shorter path to capture long-range dependencies in the source.", 
        "198": "We find it essential to use source position embeddings as well as different CNNs for attention score computation and conditional input aggregation.", 
        "199": "Our experiments show that convolutional encoders perform on par or better than baselines based on bi-directional LSTM encoders.", 
        "200": "In comparison to other recent work, our deep convolutional encoder is competitive to the best published results to date (WMT\u201916 English-Romanian) which are obtained with significantly more complex models (WMT\u201914 English-French) or stem from improvements that are orthogonal to our work (WMT\u201915 English-German).", 
        "201": "Our architecture also leads to\nlarge generation speed improvements: translation models with our convolutional encoder can translate twice as fast as strong baselines with bi-directional recurrent encoders.", 
        "202": "Future work includes better training to enable faster convergence with the convolutional encoder to better leverage the higher processing speed.", 
        "203": "Our fast architecture is interesting for character level encoders where the input is significantly longer than for words.", 
        "204": "Also, we plan to investigate the effectiveness of our architecture on other sequence-tosequence tasks, e.g.", 
        "205": "summarization, constituency parsing, dialog modeling.", 
        "206": "A Alignment Visualization  In Figure 4 and Figure 5, we plot attention scores for a sample WMT\u201915 English-German and WMT\u201914 English-French translation with BiLSTM and deep convolutional encoders.", 
        "207": "The translation is on the x-axis and the source sentence on the y-axis.", 
        "208": "The attention scores of the BiLSTM output are sharp but do not necessarily represent a correct alignment.", 
        "209": "For CNN encoders the scores are less focused but still indicate an approximate source location, e.g., in Figure 4b, when moving the clause \u201dover 1,000 people were taken hostage\u201d to the back of the translation.", 
        "210": "For some models, attention maxima are consistently shifted by one token as both in Figure 4b and Figure 5b.", 
        "211": "Interestingly, convolutional encoders tend to focus on the last token (Figure 4b) or both the first and last tokens (Figure 5b).", 
        "212": "Motivated by the hypothesis that the this may be due to the decoder depending on the length of the source sentence (which it cannot determine without position embeddings), we explicitly provided a distributed representation of the input length to the decoder and attention module.", 
        "213": "However, this did not cause a change in attention patterns nor did it improve translation accuracy.", 
        "214": "B Performance by Sentence Length\nOne characteristic of our convolutional encoder architecture is that the context over which outputs are computed depends on the number of layers.", 
        "215": "With bi-directional RNNs, every encoder output depends on the entire source sentence.", 
        "216": "In Figure 3, we evaluate whether limited context affects the translation quality on longer sentences of WMT\u201915 English-German which often requires moving verbs over long distances.", 
        "217": "We sort the newstest2015 test set by source length, partition it into 15 equallysized buckets, and compare the BLEU scores of models listed in Table 2 on a per-bucket basis.", 
        "218": "There is no clear evidence for sub-par translations on sentences that are longer than the observable context per encoder output.", 
        "219": "We include a small encoder with a 6-layer CNN-c and a 3-layer CNN-a in the comparison which performs worse than a 2- layer BiLSTM (23.3 BLEU vs. 24.1).", 
        "220": "With 6 convolutional layers at kernel width 3, each encoder output contains information of 13 adjacent source words.", 
        "221": "Looking at the accuracy for sentences with 15 words or more, this relatively shallow CNN is either on par or better than the BiLSTM for 5 out of 10 buckets; the BiLSTM has access to the entire source context.", 
        "222": "Similar observations can be made for the deeper convolutional encoders."

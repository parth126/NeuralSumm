        "44": "The two-step training procedure can be concluded as,\n\u2022 Pre-training stage: by using large-scale training data to train the neural network model, we can learn richer word embeddings, as well as relatively reasonable weights in neural networks than just training with a small amount of zero pronoun resolution task training data;\n\u2022 Adaptation stage: after getting the best model that is produced in the previous step, we continue to train the model with task-specific data, which can force the previous model to adapt to the new data, without losing much knowledge that has learned in the previous stage (such as word embeddings).",

        "58": "First, for a given zero pronoun, we extract a set of NPs as its candidates utilizing the same strategy as (Chen and Ng, 2015).", 
        "59": "Then, we use our model to generate an answer (one word) for the zero pronoun.",

        "61": "For an NP candidate, if the produced answer is its head word, we then regard this NP as the antecedent of the given zero pronoun.", 
        "62": "By doing so, for a given zero pronoun, we generate an NP as the prediction of its antecedent.", 
        "63": "2.4 Unknown Words Processing  Because of the restriction on both memory occupation and training time, it is usually suggested to use a shortlist of vocabulary in neural network training.", 
        "64": "However, we often replace the out-ofvocabularies to a unique special token, such as \u3008unk\u3009.", 
        "65": "But this may place an obstacle in real\nworld test.", 
        "66": "When the model predicts the answer as \u3008unk\u3009, we do not know what is the exact word it represents in the document, as there may have many \u3008unk\u3009s in the document.",

        "70": "Note that, the same words are projected to the same unknown word tokens, and all these projections are only valid inside of current sample.", 
        "71": "For example, \u3008unk1\u3009 indicate the first unknown word, say \u201capple\u201d, in the current sample, but in another sample the \u3008unk1\u3009 may indicate the unknown word \u201corange\u201d.", 
        "72": "That is, the unknown word labels are indicating position features rather than the exact word;\n\u2022 Insert these unknown marks in the vocabulary.", 
        "73": "These marks may only take up dozens of slots, which is negligible to the size of shortlists (usually 30K \u223c 100K).", 
        "74": "We take one sentence \u201cThe weather of today is not as pleasant as the weather of yesterday.\u201d as an example to show our unknown word processing method, which is shown in Figure 3.", 
        "75": "If we do not discriminate the unknown words and assign different unknown words with the same token \u3008unk\u3009, it would be impossible for us to know what is the exact word that \u3008unk\u3009 represents for in the real test.", 
        "76": "However, when using our proposed unknown word processing method, if the model predicts a \u3008unkX\u3009 as the answer,\nwe can simply scan through the original document and identify its position according to its unknown word number X and replace the \u3008unkX\u3009 with the real word.", 
        "77": "For example, in Figure 3, if we adopt original unknown words processing method, we could not know whether the \u3008unk\u3009 is the word \u201cweather\u201d or \u201cpleasant\u201d.", 
        "78": "However, when using our approach, if the model predicts an answer as \u3008unk1\u3009, from the original text, we can know that \u3008unk1\u3009 represents the word \u201cweather\u201d.",

        "96": "All these results approve that our proposed approach is effective and achieves significant improvements in AZP resolution.", 
        "97": "In our quantitative analysis, we investigated the reasons of the declines in the BN and TC domain.", 
        "98": "A primary observation is that the word distributions in these domains are fairly different from others.", 
        "99": "The average document length of BN and TC are quite longer than other domains, which suggest that there is a bigger chance to have unknown words than other domains, and add difficulties to the model training.", 
        "100": "Also, we have found that in the BN and TC domains, the texts are often in oral form, which means that there are many irregular expressions in the context.", 
        "101": "Such expressions add noise to the model, and it is difficult for the model to extract useful information in these contexts.", 
        "102": "These phenomena indicate that further improvements can be obtained by filtering stop words in contexts, or increasing the size of task-specific data, while we leave this in the future work.", 
        "103": "\u2022 Effect of UNK processing As we have mentioned in the previous section, traditional unknown word replacing methods are vulnerable to the real word test.",

        "113": "An intuition behind this phenomenon is that though pseudo training data is fairly big enough to train a reliable model parameters, there is still a gap to the real zero pronoun resolution tasks.", 
        "114": "On the contrary, though task-specific training data is exactly the same type as the real test, the quantity is not enough to train a reasonable model (such as word embedding).", 
        "115": "So it is better to make use of both to\ntake the full advantage.", 
        "116": "However, as the original task-specific data is fairly small compared to pseudo training data, we also wondered if the large-scale pseudo training data is only providing rich word embedding information.",

        "133": "Although our model does not intend to fill the ZP gap only with the words near the ZP, as most of the antecedents appear just a few words before the ZPs, our model prefers the nearer words as correct antecedents.", 
        "134": "Hence, once there are lots of words between ZP and its nearest antecedent, our model can sometimes make wrong decisions.",

        "37": "Data and Distant Supervision Our evidence documents are automatically gathered from either Wikipedia or more general Web search results (details in Section 3).", 
        "38": "Because we gather evidence using an automated process, the documents are not guaranteed to contain all facts needed to answer the question.", 
        "39": "Therefore, they are best seen as a source of distant supervision, based on the assumption that the presence of the answer string in an evidence document implies that the document does answer the question.3 Section 4 shows that this assumption is valid over 75% of the time, making evidence documents a strong source of distant supervision for training machine reading systems.", 
        "40": "In particular, we consider two types of distant supervision, depending on the source of our documents.", 
        "41": "For web search results, we expect the documents that contain the correct answer a to be highly redundant, and therefore let each questionanswer-document tuple be an independent data point.", 
        "42": "(|Di| = 1 for all i and qi = qj for many i, j pairs).", 
        "43": "However, in Wikipedia we generally expect most facts to be stated only once, so we instead pool all of the evidence documents and never repeat the same question in the dataset (|Di| = 1.8 on average and qi 6= qj for all i, j).", 
        "44": "In other words, each question (paired with the union of all of its evidence documents) is a single data point.", 
        "45": "These are far from the only assumptions that could be made in this distant supervision setup.", 
        "46": "For example, our data would also support multiinstance learning, which makes the at least once assumption, from relation extraction (Riedel et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011) or many other possibilities.",

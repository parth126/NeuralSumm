        "162": "5This is approximately duration in milliseconds 10\u00d7stride .", 
        "163": "4.4 Predicting word presence  Results from the previous experiment suggest that our model acquires information about higher level building blocks (words) in the continuous speech signal.", 
        "164": "Here we explore whether it can detect the presence or absence of individual words in an utterance.", 
        "165": "We formulate detecting a word in an utterance as a binary classification task, for which we use a multi-layer perceptron with a single hidden layer of size 1024, optimized by Adam.", 
        "166": "The input to the model is a concatenation of the feature vector representing an utterance and the one representing a target word.", 
        "167": "We again use utterance embeddings, average unit activations on each layer, and average input vectors as features, and represent each target word as a vector of MFCC features extracted from the audio signal synthetically produced for that word.", 
        "168": "For each utterance in the validation set, we randomly pick one positive and one negative target (i.e., one word that does and one that does not appear in the utterance) that is not a stop word.", 
        "169": "To balance the probability of a word being positive or negative, we use each positive target as a negative target for another utterance in the validation\nset.", 
        "170": "The MLP model is trained on the positive and negative examples corresponding to 80% of the utterances in the validation set of each dataset, and evaluated on the remaining 20%.", 
        "171": "Figure 5 shows the mean accuracy of the MLP on Flickr8K and COCO.", 
        "172": "All results using features extracted from the model are above chance (0.5), with the average unit activations of the hidden layers yielding the best results (0.65 for Flickr8K on layer 3, and 0.79 for COCO on layer 4).", 
        "173": "These numbers show that the speech model infers reliable information about word-level blocks from the low-level audio features it receives as input.", 
        "174": "The observed trend is similar to the previous task: average unit activations on the higher-level hidden layers are more informative for this task than the utterance embeddings, but the performance plateaus before the topmost layer.", 
        "175": "4.5 Sentence similarity  Next we explore to what extent the model\u2019s representations correspond to those of humans.", 
        "176": "We employ the Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge (SICK) dataset (Marelli et al., 2014).", 
        "177": "SICK consists of image descriptions taken from\nFlickr8K and video captions from the SemEval 2012 STS MSRVideo Description data set (STS) (Agirre et al., 2012).", 
        "178": "Captions were paired at random, as well as modified to obtain semantically similar and contrasting counterparts, and the resulting pairs were rated for semantic similarity.", 
        "179": "For all sentence pairs in SICK, we generate synthetic spoken sentences and feed them to the COCO Speech RHN, and calculate the cosine similarity between the averaged MFCC input vectors, the averaged hidden layer activation vectors, and the sentence embeddings.", 
        "180": "Z-score transformation was applied before calculating the cosine similarities.", 
        "181": "We then correlate these cosine similarities with\n\u2022 semantic relatedness according to human ratings \u2022 cosine similarities according to z-score transformed embeddings from COCO Text RHN \u2022 edit similarities, a measure of how similar the sentences are in form, specifically, 1\u2212normalized Levenshtein distance over character sequences\nFigure 6 shows a boxplot over 10,000 bootstrap samples for all correlations.", 
        "182": "We observe that (i) correlation with edit similarity initially increases, then decreases; (ii) correlation with human relatedness scores and text model embeddings increases until layer 4, but decreases for hidden layer 5.", 
        "183": "The initially increasing and then decreasing correlation with edit similarity is consistent with the findings that information about form is encoded by lower layers.", 
        "184": "The overall growing correlation with both human semantic similarity ratings and\nthe COCO Text RHN indicate that higher layers learn to represent semantic knowledge.", 
        "185": "We were somewhat surprised by the pattern for the correlation with human ratings and the Text model similarities which drops for layer 5.", 
        "186": "We suspect it may be caused by the model at this point in the layer hierarchy being strongly tuned to the specifics of the COCO dataset.", 
        "187": "To test this, we checked the correlations with COCO Text embeddings on validation sentences from the COCO dataset instead of SICK.", 
        "188": "These increased monotonically, in support of our conjecture.", 
        "189": "4.6 Homonym disambiguation  Next we simulate the task of distinguishing between pairs of homonyms, i.e.", 
        "190": "words with the same acoustic form but different meaning.", 
        "191": "We group the words in the union of the training and validation data of the COCO dataset by their phonetic transcription.", 
        "192": "We then pick pairs of words which have the same pronunciation but different spelling, for example suite/sweet.", 
        "193": "We impose the following conditions: (a) both forms appear more than 20 times, (b) the two forms have different meaning (i.e.", 
        "194": "they are not simply variant spellings like theater/theatre), (c) neither form is a function word, and (d) the more frequent form constitutes less than 95% of the occurrences.", 
        "195": "This\ngives us 34 word pairs.", 
        "196": "For each pair we generate a binary classification task by taking all the utterances where either form appears, using average input vectors, utterance embeddings, and average unit activations as features.", 
        "197": "Instances for all feature sets are normalized to unit L2 norm.", 
        "198": "For each task and feature set we run stratified 10-fold cross validation using Logistic Regression to predict which of the two words the utterance contains.", 
        "199": "Figure 7 shows, for each pair, the relative error reduction of each feature set with respect to the majority baseline.", 
        "200": "There is substantial variation across word pairs, but overall the task becomes easier as the features come from higher layers in the network.", 
        "201": "Some forms can be disambiguated with very high accuracy (e.g.", 
        "202": "sale/sail, cole/coal, pairs/pears), while some others cannot be distinguished at all (peaking/peeking, great/grate, mantle/mantel).", 
        "203": "We examined the sentences containing the failing forms, and found out that almost all occurrences of peaking and mantle were misspellings of peeking and mantel, which explains the impossibility of disambiguating these cases.", 
        "204": "5 Conclusion  We present a multi-layer recurrent highway network model of language acquisition from visually grounded speech signal.", 
        "205": "Through detailed analysis we uncover how information in the input signal is transformed as it flows through the network: formal aspects of language such as word identities that not directly present in the input are discovered and encoded low in the layer hierarchy, while semantic information is most strongly expressed in the topmost layers.", 
        "206": "Going forward we would like to compare the representations learned by our model to the brain activity of people listening to speech in order to determine to what extent the patterns we found correspond to localized processing in the human cortex.", 
        "207": "This will hopefully lead to a better understanding of language learning and processing by both artificial and neural networks.",

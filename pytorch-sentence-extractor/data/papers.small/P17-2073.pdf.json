        "15": "In the example shown in Figure 1, \u201cteenager survived Boston Marathon bombing\u201d, the connotation frame allows us to correctly interpret (implied) targeted sentiments including:\n1. sentiment(teenager\u2192 bombing) = \u2013 2. sentiment(writer\u2192 bombing) = \u2013 3. sentiment(writer\u2192 teenager) = + Second, they allow us to study a broad spectrum of sentiments including nuanced ones; in the ex-\n459\namples discussed above, connotation frames allow us to infer (1) the likely sentiment among the event participants (e.g., a surviving teenager is likely to be negative toward the Boston bombing), and (2) the likely sentiment of the author towards events and entities (e.g., the writer is likely to be sympathetic toward the teenager while negative toward the incident), even though none of these sentiment implications are overtly expressed.", 
        "16": "To validate the empirical utility of the new multilingual connotation lexicon, we present a successful case study of large scale connotation analysis (Section 4.1) and forecast (Section 4.2) based on connotation frames extracted from 1.2 million tweets in 10 different European languages spanning over a 15 day period.",

        "22": "Since connotation of a word arises from the context in which the word is used, we want to ensure the translated connotation frames are used in similar contexts.", 
        "23": "We use existing parallel corpora with automatic word-alignment: the Opus Corpus (Tiedemann, 2012) using Multi-UN parallel data (Eisele and Chen, 2010) for Russian and EuroParl parallel data (Koehn, 2005) for all other languages.", 
        "24": "More concretely, for each non-English verb, v\u2032 (e.g., assassiner in French), we compute the probability of it being translated to English verb v by counting the alignments.", 
        "25": "We then define the connotation frame of v\u2032, F(v\u2032), by transferring the connotation frame of the English verb v\u2217, F(v\u2217), that has the highest translation probability:\nv\u2217 = argmaxvp(v|v\u2032)\nF(v\u2032) = F(v\u2217) For example, the connotation frame for assassiner is propagated from murder, the English word that it is aligned with the most.",

        "27": "We also compute sentiments expressed by each\ncountry by aggregating all sentiments of the writers located in that country (e.g., the distribution of positive, neutral, and negative perspectives expressed towards Obama in British tweets).",

        "29": "For other analysis, we summarize this polarity distribution as a scalar score by taking the expected value of the polarity: E[p] = p+ \u2212 p\u2212.", 
        "30": "3.3 Forecasting Sentiment Dynamics  We also study forecasting sentiment dynamics: predicting the sentiment distribution of the next day given the sentiment trend of previous days.", 
        "31": "For this task, we track the distribution of directional sentiments from each country towards the hundred most-frequently-mentioned named entities.", 
        "32": "At test-time, each model is given directional sentiment distributions for the previous 4 days as input and predicts tomorrow\u2019s distribution (e.g., forecasting 1 day ahead).", 
        "33": "We also train models for predicting the distribution half a week later (forecasting 4 days ahead).", 
        "34": "We performed an additional experiment for English (ENJ ) where the perspectives of all countries are aggregated together in order to predict the global perspective.", 
        "35": "For all experiments, we use 10-fold cross-validation and measure the symmetric Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the true distribution and the predicted one.", 
        "36": "We experiment with Long Short-term Memory\nmodels (LSTMs) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) to integrate the dynamic contextual information from the past, as depicted in 2.", 
        "37": "Hidden dimension is 16, and we use ADAM optimization with KL divergence as the objective.", 
        "38": "For implementation, we use Keras4 on top of Theano.5\nBaselines We use two baselines.", 
        "39": "The first is MEAN, the average distribution seen in the training data.", 
        "40": "The second are SVMs with linear kernels, which worked well in predicting influenza activity in a similar set-up (Santillana et al., 2015).", 
        "41": "For the baselines, we encode the distributions from the 4 previous days as a flattened 12-dim.", 
        "42": "vector, and each portion of the distribution is predicted separately.", 
        "43": "4 Results    4.1 Connotation Analysis  For the most frequently mentioned named entities, we compute heatmaps of the expected perspective being expressed towards that entity.", 
        "44": "In Figure 3A, we use the English tweets from European countries to plot the change in connotative polarity towards these entities over the course of the 15 day period.", 
        "45": "Generally, the changes in polarity from day-to-day seem to be gradual and frequently are similar to the day before.", 
        "46": "There are a couple of exceptions e.g., the polarity towards\n4https://keras.io 5https://deeplearning.net/software/\ntheano\nBrussels changes abruptly on March 22 (the day of the Brussels attacks), reflecting the change in tone of all tweets related to Brussels at that time.", 
        "47": "Overall, there are mostly positive polarities expressed.", 
        "48": "This may reflect people\u2019s tendency to avoid phrasing stories too harshly, choosing to be more euphemistic even when they discuss bad news.", 
        "49": "In Figure 3B, we aggregated the polarities of these tweets by country of origin.", 
        "50": "While most of the polarities are positive-strongly positive, the tweets about Brussels and Belgium are more neutral or even slightly negative.", 
        "51": "Lastly, in Figure 3C, we used all of the tweets from European countries to aggregate expected polarities in 11 different languages.", 
        "52": "Non-English languages show a much higher tendency towards positive scores, particularly the languages with less tweets (Polish, Finnish, Swedish).", 
        "53": "As a more detailed analysis, Figure 4 shows a heatmap of how the connotation expressed towards Obama shifts over time across different languages.", 
        "54": "Obama was not discussed much in Finnish or Swedish, whereas he was discussed everyday in English, Spanish, and Russian.", 
        "55": "In the middle of the two week period, the perspective towards Obama drops slightly, most notably in Spanish, which overlaps with his controversial trip to Cuba (March 20 \u2013 22).", 
        "56": "4.2 Sentiment Dynamics  In Table 2, we summarize the results of our experiments for predicting targetted sentiment dynamics.", 
        "57": "For each language, we report the average Kullback-Leibler divergence for the baselines and the LSTM model (higher scores are worse).", 
        "58": "We show prediction results in two settings: predicting\nthe distribution one day ahead vs. four days ahead.", 
        "59": "The LSTM outperforms the baselines in most languages with a few exceptions, such as Portuguese.", 
        "60": "All models perform worse at forecasting 4 days into the future than one day ahead, demonstrating how much connotation can vary over time as news events change, even in a small time period.", 
        "61": "On average, the LSTM achieves KL-divergence of 1.7 when predicting one day ahead and 3.26 when predicting 4 days ahead, lower than any of the baselines.", 
        "62": "4.3 Error Analysis  For error analysis, we removed entities from Figure 3 from the training data and used them as a small test set for an LSTM trained on the remaining data in English with aggregation over all countries.", 
        "63": "In Figure 5, we have plotted the predicted marginal probabilities of four entities with the positive portion of the distribution (blue line) on the top half of the y-axis and the negative portion (red line) flipped onto the negative half of the axis.", 
        "64": "The LSTM follows the general shape of the true curves, but frequently misses sudden spikes (e.g., the spike in negative polarity towards Russia on March 27th).", 
        "65": "In Table 3, we also report the KL divergences on predictions towards these entities.", 
        "66": "The model tends to perform less well at predicting sentiment towards entities where there were sudden spikes in sentiment based on news stories.", 
        "67": "5 Related Work  There have been substantial studies for sentiment analysis on twitter (Agarwal et al., 2011; Kouloumpis et al., 2011; Pak and Paroubek, 2010;\nLiu and Zhang, 2012), as well as targetted sentiment (Deng and Wiebe, 2015), implicit sentiment (Deng and Wiebe, 2014; Feng et al., 2013; Greene and Resnik, 2009) and specific aspects of subjective language (Mohammad and Turney, 2010; Choi and Wiebe, 2014) in other domains.",

        "69": "Compared to most prior studies that focused on overt sentiment in English-only tweets, our work aims to study targeted implied sentiments across temporal, spatial, and linguistic borders.", 
        "70": "Some work (Tsytsarau et al., 2014; O\u2019Connor et al., 2010; De et al., 2016) has analyzed the transition of overt sentiment over a period of time and related the shifts in sentiment to news events.", 
        "71": "A body of work has also used predictive signals in Twitter to track and sense upcoming unrest and protests in specific countries (Ramakrishnan et al., 2014; Goode et al., 2015), and the future progression of flu activity based on multiple text sources (Santillana et al., 2015).",

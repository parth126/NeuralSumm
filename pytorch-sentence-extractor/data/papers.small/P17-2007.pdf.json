        "2": "We consider two multilingual scenarios: 1) the single-source setting, where the input consists of a single sentence in a single language, and 2) the multi-source setting, where the input consists of parallel sentences in multiple languages.",

        "8": "Our model consists of multiple encoders, one for each language, and one decoder that is shared across source languages for generating semantic representations.", 
        "9": "In this way, the proposed model potentially benefits from having a generic decoder that works well across languages.", 
        "10": "Intuitively, the model encourages each source language encoder to find a common structured representation for the decoder.", 
        "11": "We further modify the attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2015) to integrate multisource information, such that it can learn where to focus during parsing; i.e., which input positions in which languages.",

        "26": "Unlike the mainstream approach that trains one monolingual parser per source language, our approach integrates N encoders, one for each language, into a single model.", 
        "27": "This model encodes a sentence from the n-th language X = x1, x2, ..., x|X| as a vector and then uses a shared decoder to decode the encoded vector into its corresponding logical form Y = y1, y2, ..., y|Y |.",

        "30": "The encoder is implemented as a unidirectional RNN with long short-term memory (LSTM) units (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), which takes a sequence of natural language tokens as input.", 
        "31": "Similar to previous multi-task frameworks, e.g., in neural MT (Firat et al., 2016; Zoph and Knight, 2016), we create one encoder per source language, i.e., {\u03a8nenc}Nn=1.", 
        "32": "For the n-th language, it updates the hidden vector at time step t by:\nhnt = \u03a8 n enc(h n t\u22121,E n x[xt]) (1)\nwhere \u03a8nenc is the LSTM function and E n x \u2208 R|V |\u00d7d is an embedding matrix containing row vectors of the source tokens in the n-th language.",

        "34": "In the basic sequence-to-sequence model, the decoder generates each target token in a linear fashion.", 
        "35": "However, in semantic parsing, such a model ignores the hierarchical structure of logical forms.", 
        "36": "In order to alleviate this issue, Dong and Lapata (2016) proposed a decoder that generates logical forms in a top-down manner, where they define a \u201cnon-terminal\u201d token <n> to indicate subtrees.", 
        "37": "At each depth in the tree, logical forms are generated sequentially until the end-ofsequence token is output.", 
        "38": "Unlike in the single language setting, here we define a single, shared decoder \u03a8dec as opposed to one decoder per source language.",

        "40": "The attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015) computes a timedependent context vector ct (as defined later in Section 3.1 and 3.2), which is subsequently used for computing the probability distribution over the next symbol, as follows:\nz\u0303t = tanh(Uzt + Vct) (3) p(yt|y<t, X) \u221d exp(Wz\u0303t) (4)\nwhere U, V, and W are weight matrices.",

        "45": "The last state of the n-th encoder is used to initialize the first state of the decoder.", 
        "46": "We may need to first project the encoder vector into a suitable dimension for the decoder, i.e., z0 = \u03c6ndec(h n |X|), where \u03c6ndec can be an affine transformation.",

        "51": "In the second version, the three weight matrices are shared across languages, essentially reducing the number of parameters by a factor of N .", 
        "52": "The training data consists of the union of sentence-semantics pairs in N languages, where the source sentences are not necessarily parallel.", 
        "53": "We implement a scheduling mechanism that cycles through all languages during training, one language at a time.", 
        "54": "Specifically, model parameters are updated after one batch from one language before moving to the next one.",

        "59": "It\nincludes a combiner module (denoted by the grey box), which we will explain next.", 
        "60": "The decoder state at the first time step is initialized by first combining the N final states from each encoder, i.e., z0 = \u03c6init(h1|X|, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,hN|X|), where we implement \u03c6init by max-pooling.", 
        "61": "We propose two ways of computing ct that integrates source-side information from multiple encoders.", 
        "62": "First, we consider word-level combination, where we combine N encoder states at every time step, as follows:\n\u03b1nk,t = exp(h\u0303nk \u00b7 zt)\u2211N\nn\u2032=1 \u2211|X| k\u2032=1 exp(h\u0303 n\u2032 k\u2032 \u00b7 zt)\n(8)\nct = N\u2211\nn=1\n|X|\u2211\nk=1\n\u03b1nk,th\u0303 n k (9)\nAlternatively, in sentence-level combination, we first compute the context vector for each language in the same way as Equation 6 and 7.", 
        "63": "Then, we perform a simple concatenation of N context vectors: ct = [ c1t ; \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ; cNt ] .", 
        "64": "Unlike the single-source setting, the training data consists of N -way parallel sentencesemantics pairs.",

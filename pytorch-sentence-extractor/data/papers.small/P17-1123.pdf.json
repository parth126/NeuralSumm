        "4": "Question generation systems can also be deployed as chatbot components (e.g., asking questions to start a conversation or to request feedback (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016)) or, arguably, as a clinical tool for evaluating or improving mental health (Weizenbaum, 1966; Colby et al., 1971).", 
        "5": "In addition to the above applications, question generation systems can aid in the development of\nannotated data sets for natural language processing (NLP) research in reading comprehension and question answering.", 
        "6": "Indeed the creation of such datasets, e.g., SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) and MS MARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016), has spurred research in these areas.",

        "10": "To improve over a purely rule-based system, Heilman and Smith (2010) introduced an overgenerate-and-rank approach that generates multiple questions from an input sentence using a rule-based approach and then ranks them using a supervised learning-based ranker.", 
        "11": "Although the ranking algorithm helps to produce more ac-\n1342\nceptable questions, it relies heavily on a manually crafted feature set, and the questions generated often overlap word for word with the tokens in the input sentence, making them very easy to answer.", 
        "12": "Vanderwende (2008) point out that learning to ask good questions is an important task in NLP research in its own right, and should consist of more than the syntactic transformation of a declarative sentence.", 
        "13": "In particular, a natural sounding question often compresses the sentence on which it is based (e.g., question 3 in Figure 1), uses synonyms for terms in the passage (e.g., \u201cform\u201d for \u201cproduce\u201d in question 2 and \u201cget\u201d for \u201cproduce\u201d in question 3), or refers to entities from preceding sentences or clauses (e.g., the use of \u201cphotosynthesis\u201d in question 2).", 
        "14": "Othertimes, world knowledge is employed to produce a good question (e.g., identifying \u201cphotosynthesis\u201d as a \u201clife process\u201d in question 1).", 
        "15": "In short, constructing natural questions of reasonable difficulty would seem to require an abstractive approach that can produce fluent phrasings that do not exactly match the text from which they were drawn.", 
        "16": "As a result, and in contrast to all previous work, we propose here to frame the task of question generation as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem that directly maps a sentence from a text passage to a question.",

        "18": "More specifically, inspired by the recent success in neural machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015), summarization (Rush et al., 2015; Iyer et al., 2016), and image caption generation (Xu et al., 2015), we tackle question generation using a conditional neural language model with a global attention mechanism (Luong et al., 2015a).", 
        "19": "We investigate several variations of this model, including one that takes into account paragraph- rather than sentence-level information from the reading passage as well as other variations that determine the importance of pre-trained vs. learned word embeddings.", 
        "20": "In evaluations on the SQuAD dataset (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) using three automatic evaluation metrics, we find that our system significantly outperforms a collection of strong baselines, including an information retrieval-based system (Robertson and Walker, 1994), a statistical machine translation approach (Koehn et al., 2007), and the overgenerate-and-rank approach of Heil-\nman and Smith (2010).", 
        "21": "Human evaluations also rated our generated questions as more grammatical, fluent, and challenging (in terms of syntactic divergence from the original reading passage and reasoning needed to answer) than the state-of-theart Heilman and Smith (2010) system.",

        "161": "METEOR is a recall-oriented metric, which calculates the similarity between generations and references by considering synonyms, stemming and paraphrases.", 
        "162": "ROUGE is commonly employed to evaluate n-grams recall of the summaries with goldstandard sentences as references.", 
        "163": "ROUGEL (measured based on longest common subsequence) results are reported.", 
        "164": "5.5 Human Evaluation  We also perform human evaluation studies to measure the quality of questions generated by our system and the H&S system.", 
        "165": "We consider two modalities: naturalness, which indicates the grammaticality and fluency; and difficulty, which measures the sentence-question syntactic divergence and the reasoning needed to answer the question.", 
        "166": "We randomly sampled 100 sentence-question pairs.", 
        "167": "We ask four professional English speakers to rate the pairs in terms of the modalities above on a 1\u20135 scale (5 for the best).", 
        "168": "We then ask the human raters to give a ranking of the questions according to the overall quality, with ties allowed.",

        "170": "Our model which only encodes sentence-level information achieves\nthe best performance across all metrics.", 
        "171": "We note that IR performs poorly, indicating that memorizing the training set is not enough for the task.", 
        "172": "The baseline DirectIn performs pretty well on BLEU and METEOR, which is reasonable given the overlap statistics between the sentences and the questions (Figure 2).", 
        "173": "H&S system\u2019s performance is on a par with DirectIn\u2019s, as it basically performs syntactic change without paraphrasing, and the overlap rate is also high.", 
        "174": "Looking at the performance of our three models, it\u2019s clear that adding the pre-trained embeddings generally helps.", 
        "175": "While encoding the paragraph causes the performance to drop a little, this makes sense because, apart from useful information, the paragraph also contains much noise.",

        "179": "An inter-rater agreement of Krippendorff\u2019s Alpha of 0.236 is achieved for the overall ranking.", 
        "180": "The results imply that our model can generate questions of better quality than the H&S system.", 
        "181": "For our qualitative analysis, we examine the sample outputs and the visualization of the alignment between the input and the output.",

        "183": "We see a large gap between our results and H&S\u2019s.", 
        "184": "For example, in the first sample, in which the focus should be put on \u201cthe largest.\u201d Our model successfully captures this information, while H&S only performs some syntactic transformation over the input without paraphrasing.", 
        "185": "However, outputs from our system are not always \u201cperfect\u201d, for example, in pair 6, our system generates a question about the reason why birds still grow, but the most related question would be why many species still grow.", 
        "186": "But from\na different perspective, our question is more challenging (readers need to understand that birds are one kind of species), which supports our system\u2019s performance listed in human evaluations (See Table 3).", 
        "187": "It would be interesting to further investigate how to interpret why certain irrelavant words are generated in the question.", 
        "188": "Figure 4 shows the attention weights (\u03b1i,t) for the input sentence when generating each token in the question.",

        "190": "aligns well with those in the input sentence.", 
        "191": "Finally, we do a dataset analysis and finegrained system performance analysis.", 
        "192": "We randomly sampled 346 sentence-question pairs from the dev set and label each pair with a category.", 
        "193": "5 The four categories are determined by how much information is needed to ask the question.",

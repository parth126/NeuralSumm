        "42": "Although it lies outside the scope of this paper to explore how to exploit chat detection method in a full dialogue system, the chat detection method is considered to serve, for example, as one component within those frameworks.", 
        "43": "2.2 Intent and domain determination  Chat detection is related to, but different from, intent and domain determination that have been studied in the field of SDS (Guo et al., 2014; Xu and Sarikaya, 2014; Ravuri and Stolcke, 2015; Kim et al., 2016; Zhang and Wang, 2016).", 
        "44": "Both intent and domain determination have been investigated in domain-specific task-oriented SDS.", 
        "45": "Intent determination aims to determine the type of information a user is seeking in singledomain task-oriented SDS.", 
        "46": "For example, in the ATIS dataset, which is collected from an airline travel information service system, the information type includes flight, city, and so on (Tur et al., 2010).", 
        "47": "On the other hand, domain determination aims to determine which domain is relevant to a given user utterance in multi-domain task-oriented SDS (Xu and Sarikaya, 2014).", 
        "48": "Note that it is possible that domain determination is followed by intent determination.", 
        "49": "Unlike intent and domain determination, chat detection targets hybrid systems of multi-domain task-oriented SDS and open-domain non-taskoriented SDS, and aims to determine whether the non-task-oriented component is responsible to a given user utterance or not (i.e., the user is going to have a chat or not).", 
        "50": "Therefore, the objective of chat detection is different from intent and domain determination.", 
        "51": "It may be possible to see chat detection as a spe-\ncific problem of domain determination (Sarikaya, 2017).", 
        "52": "We, nevertheless, discuss it as a different problem because of the uniqueness of the \u201cchat domain.\u201d It greatly differs from ordinary domains in that it plays a role of combining the two different types of SDS that have long been studied independently, rather than combining multiple SDS of the same types.", 
        "53": "In addition, we discuss the use of external resources, especially tweets, for chat detection.", 
        "54": "This approach is unique to chat detection and is not considered effective for ordinary domain determination.", 
        "55": "It is interesting to note that chat detection is not followed by slot-filling unlike intent and domain determination, as far as we use a popular response generator such as seq2seq model (Sutskever et al., 2014) or an information retrieval based approach (Yan et al., 2016).", 
        "56": "Although joint intent (or domain) determination and slot-filling has been widely studied to improve accuracy (Guo et al., 2014; Zhang and Wang, 2016), the same approach is not feasible in chat detection.", 
        "57": "2.3 Intelligent assistant  Previous studies on intelligent assistants have not investigated chat detection.", 
        "58": "Their research topics are centered around those on user behaviors including the prediction of user satisfaction and engagement (Jiang et al., 2015; Kobayashi et al., 2015; Sano et al., 2016; Kiseleva et al., 2016a,b) and gamification (Otani et al., 2016).",

        "63": "Some earlier works used the Cortana dataset as a benchmark of domain determination (Guo et al., 2014; Xu and Sarikaya, 2014; Kim et al., 2016) or proposed a development framework for Cortana (Crook et al., 2016).", 
        "64": "Those studies, however, regarded the intelligent assistant as merely one example of multi-domain task-oriented SDS and did not explore chat detection.", 
        "65": "2.4 Non-task-oriented SDS  Non-task-oriented SDS have long been studied in the research community.", 
        "66": "While early studies adopted rule-based methods (Weizenbaum, 1966; Wallace, 2009), statistical approaches have re-\ncently gained much popularity (Ritter et al., 2011; Vinyals and Le, 2015).",

        "70": "To date, a number follow-up studies have been made to improve on the response quality (Hasegawa et al., 2013; Shang et al., 2015; Sordoni et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016a,b; Gu et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2016).", 
        "71": "Those studies assume that users always want to have chats with systems and investigate only methods of generating appropriate responses to given utterances.", 
        "72": "Chat detection is required for integrating those response generators into intelligent assistants.", 
        "73": "2.5 Use of conversational data  The recent explosion of conversational data on the Web, especially tweets, have triggered a variety of dialogue studies.", 
        "74": "Those typically used tweets either for training response generators (c.f., Section 2.4) or for discovering dialogue acts in an unsupervised fashion (Ritter et al., 2010; Higashinaka et al., 2011).", 
        "75": "This treatment of tweets differs from that in our work.", 
        "76": "3 Chat Detection Dataset  In this section we explain how we constructed the new benchmark dataset for chat detection.",

        "78": "3.1 Construction procedure  We sampled 15, 160 unique utterances5 (i.e., automatic speech recognition results) from the real log data of a commercial intelligent assistant, Yahoo!", 
        "79": "Voice Assist.6 The log data were collected between Jan. and Aug. 2016.", 
        "80": "In the log data, some utterances such as \u201cHello\u201d appear frequently.", 
        "81": "To construct a dataset containing both high and low frequency utterances, we set frequency thresholds7 to divide the utterances into three groups (high, middle, and low frequency) and then randomly sampled the same number of utterances\n5The utterances are all in Japanese.", 
        "82": "Example utterances given in this paper are English translations.", 
        "83": "6https://v-assist.yahoo.co.jp 7We cannot disclose the exact threshold values so as to keep the detailed statistics of the original log data confidential.", 
        "84": "from each of the three groups.", 
        "85": "During the data collection, we ensured privacy by manually removing utterances that included the full name of a person or detailed address information.", 
        "86": "Next, we recruited crowd workers to annotate the 15, 160 utterances with two labels, CHAT and NONCHAT.", 
        "87": "The workers annotated the CHAT label when users were going to have chats with the intelligent assistant and annotated the NONCHAT label when users were seeking some information (e.g., searching the Web or checking the weather) or were trying to operate the smartphones (e.g., setting alarms or controlling volume).", 
        "88": "Note that our intelligent assistant works primarily on smartphones and thus the NONCHAT utterances include many operational instructions such as alarm setting.", 
        "89": "Example utterances are given in Table 1.", 
        "90": "Seven workers were assigned to each utterance, and the final labels were obtained by majority vote to address the quality issue inherent in crowdsourcing.", 
        "91": "The last column in Table 1 shows the number of votes that the majority label obtained.", 
        "92": "For example, five workers provided the CHAT label (and the other two provided the NONCHAT label) to the first utterance \u201cLet\u2019s talk about something.\u201d  3.2 Data analysis  The construction process described above yielded a dataset made up of 4, 833 CHAT and 10, 327 NONCHAT utterances.", 
        "93": "We investigated the annotation agreement among the crowd workers.", 
        "94": "Table 2 shows the distribution of the numbers of votes that the majority labels obtained.", 
        "95": "The annotation given by the seven workers agreed perfectly in 5, 811 of the 15, 160 utterances (38%).", 
        "96": "Also, at least six workers agreed in the majority of cases, 10, 789 (= 4, 978 + 5, 811) utterances (71%).", 
        "97": "This indicates high agreement among the workers and the reliability of the annotation results.", 
        "98": "During the data construction, we found that a typical confusing case arises when the utterance can be interpreted as an implicit information request.", 
        "99": "For example, the utterance \u201cI am hungry\u201d can be seen as the user trying to have a chat with the assistant, but it might be the case that she is looking for a local restaurant.", 
        "100": "Similar examples include \u201cI have a backache\u201d and so on.", 
        "101": "One solution in this case might be to ask the user a clarification question (Schlo\u0308der and Fernandez, 2015).", 
        "102": "Such an exploration is left for our future research.", 
        "103": "Additionally, we manually classified the CHAT utterances according to their dialogue acts to figure out how real users have chats with the intelligent assistant (Table 3).", 
        "104": "The set of dialogue acts was designed by referring to (Meguro et al., 2010).", 
        "105": "As shown in Table 3, while some of the utterances are boilerplates (e.g., those in the GREETING act) and thus have limited variety, the majority of the utterances exhibit tremendous diversity.", 
        "106": "We see\na wide variety of topics including private issues (e.g., \u201cI am free today\u201d) and questions to the assistant (e.g., \u201cAre you angry?\u201d).", 
        "107": "Also, we even see a movie quote (\u201cMay the force be with you\u201d) and a rooster crow (\u201cCock-a-doodle-doo\u201d) in the MISC act.", 
        "108": "These clearly represent the open-domain nature of the user utterances in intelligent assistants.", 
        "109": "Interestingly, some users curse at the intelligent assistant probably because it failed to make appropriate responses (see the CURSE act).", 
        "110": "Although such user behavior would not be observed from paid research participants, we observe a certain amount of curse utterances in the real data.", 
        "111": "4 Detection Method  We formulate chat detection as a binary classification problem to train supervised classifiers.", 
        "112": "In this section, we first explain the two types of classifiers explored in this paper, and then investigate the use of external resources for enhancing those classifiers.", 
        "113": "4.1 Base classifiers  The first classifier utilizes SVM for its popularity and efficiency.", 
        "114": "It uses character and word ngram (n = 1 and 2) features.",

        "116": "A skipgram model (Mikolov et al., 2013) is trained on\nthe entire intelligent assistant log8 to learn word embeddings.", 
        "117": "The embeddings of the words in the utterance are then averaged to produce additional features.", 
        "118": "The second classifier uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) because it has recently proven to perform well on text classification problems (Kim, 2014; Johnson and Zhang, 2015a,b).",

        "191": "The best performing method, SVM+embed.+tweet-query, achieves 92% accuracy and 87% F1-score, outperforming all of the baselines.", 
        "192": "CNN performed worse than SVM contrary to results reported by recent studies (Kim, 2014).", 
        "193": "We think this is because the architecture of our CNN is rather simplistic.", 
        "194": "It might be possible to improve the CNN-based classifier by adopting more complex network, although it is likely to come at the cost of extra training time.", 
        "195": "Another reason would be that our SVM classifier uses carefully designed features beyond word 1-grams.", 
        "196": "Table 4 also represents that the external resources are effective, improving F1-scores almost 1 points in both SVM and CNN.",

        "198": "We see that the language models trained on the tweets and queries successfully provide the CHAT utterances with high and low scores, respectively.", 
        "199": "Table 6 shows chat detection results when each of the three features derived from the external resources is added to SVM+embed.", 
        "200": "The results represent that they are all worse than SVM+embed.+tweet-query and thus it is crucial to combine all of them for achieving the best performance.",

        "206": "We also see that the first person has a large positive weight, while terms related to device controlling (\u201ccall to\u201d and \u201cvolume\u201d) have large negative weights.",

        "209": "In fact, we see as much as 98% accuracy when all seven workers agree.", 
        "210": "This implies that utterances easy for humans to classify are also easy for the classifiers.",

        "212": "Figure 3 illustrates the learning curve.", 
        "213": "It represents that the classification accuracy improves almost monotonically as the training data size increases.", 
        "214": "Although our training data is by no means small, the shape of the learning curve nevertheless suggests that further improvement would be achieved by adding more training data.", 
        "215": "This im-\nplies that a very large amount of training data are required for covering open-domain utterances in intelligent assistants.", 
        "216": "The figure at the same time represents the usefulness of the external resources.",

        "222": "and SVM+embed.+tweet-query for each utterance length in the number of characters.", 
        "223": "Figure 4 reveals that the difference between the two proposed methods is evident in short utterances (i.e., \u2264 5).", 
        "224": "This is because those utterances are too short to contain sufficient information required for classification, and the additional features are helpful.", 
        "225": "We note that Japanese writing system uses ideograms and thus even five characters is enough to represent a simple sentence.", 
        "226": "We also see a clear difference in longer utterances (i.e., 15 \u2264) as well.", 
        "227": "We consider those long utterances are difficult to classify because some words in the utterances are irrelevant for the classification and the n-gram and embedding features include those irrelevant ones.", 
        "228": "On the other hand, we consider that the language model scores are good at capturing stylistic information irrespective of the utterance length.", 
        "229": "6 Future Work  As discussed in Section 3.2, some user utterances such as \u201cI am hungry\u201d are ambiguous in nature and thus are difficult to handle in the current framework.", 
        "230": "An important future work is to develop a sophisticated dialogue manager to handle such utterances, for example, by making clarification questions (Schlo\u0308der and Fernandez, 2015).", 
        "231": "We manually investigated the dialogue acts in the chat detection dataset (c.f., Section 3.2).", 
        "232": "It is interesting to automatically determine the dialogue acts to help producing appropriate system responses.", 
        "233": "Some related studies exist in such a research direction (Meguro et al., 2010).", 
        "234": "Although we used only text data to perform\nchat detection, we can also utilize contextual information such as the previous utterances (Xu and Sarikaya, 2014), the acoustic information (Jiang et al., 2015), and the user profile (Sano et al., 2016).", 
        "235": "It is an interesting research topic to use such contextual information beyond text.", 
        "236": "It is considered promising to make use of a neural network for integrating such heterogeneous information.", 
        "237": "An automatic speech recognition (ASR) error is a popular problem in SDS, and previous studies have proposed sophisticated techniques, including re-ranking (Morbini et al., 2012) and POMDP (Williams and Young, 2007), for addressing the ASR errors.", 
        "238": "Incorporating these techniques into our methods is also an important future work.", 
        "239": "Although the studies on non-task-oriented SDS have made substantial progress in the past few years, it unfortunately remains difficult for the systems to fluently chat with users (Higashinaka et al., 2015).", 
        "240": "Further efforts on improving nontask-oriented dialogue systems is an important future work.", 
        "241": "7 Conclusion  This paper investigated chat detection for combining domain-specific task-oriented SDS and opendomain non-task-oriented SDS.", 
        "242": "To address the scarcity of benchmark datasets for this task, we constructed a new benchmark dataset from the real log data of a commercial intelligent assistant.", 
        "243": "In addition, we investigated using the external resources, tweets and Web search queries, to handle open-domain user utterances, which characterize the task of chat detection.", 
        "244": "The empirical experiment demonstrated that the off-the-shelf supervised methods augmented with the external resources perform accurately, outperforming the baseline approaches.", 
        "245": "We hope that this study contributes to remove the long-standing boundary between task-oriented and non-task-oriented SDS.", 
        "246": "To facilitate future research, we are going to release the dataset together with the feature values derived from the tweets and Web search queries.14  Acknowledgments  We thank Manabu Sassano, Chikara Hashimoto, Naoki Yoshinaga, and Masashi Toyoda for fruitful discussions and comments.",

        "182": "During training, instances with more than one annotated relation types are considered as multiple instances, each of which has one of the annotations.",

        "199": "4) \u201cMulti-task\u201d is the convolutional net augmented with an additional task of simultaneously predicting the implicit connectives based on the network features.", 
        "200": "As a straightforward way of incorporating connectives, we see that the method slightly improves over the stand-alone CNN, while falling behind our approach with a large margin.", 
        "201": "This indicates that our proposed feature imitation is a more effective scheme for making use of implicit connectives.", 
        "202": "5) At last, \u201c`2-reg\u201d also implements feature mimicking by imposing an `2 distance penalty between the implicit relation features and connective-augmented features.", 
        "203": "We see that the simple model has obtained improvement over previous best-performing systems in both settings, further validating the idea of imitation.", 
        "204": "However, in contrast to the fixed `2 regularization, our adversarial framework provides an adaptive mechanism, which is more flexible and performs better as shown in the table.",

        "216": "The rise-and-fall patterns in the accuracy of the discriminator clearly show its competition with the implicit relation network i-CNN as training goes.", 
        "217": "At first few iterations the accuracy of the discriminator increases quickly to over 0.9, while at late stage the accuracy drops to around 0.6, showing that the discriminator is getting confused by i-CNN (an accuracy of 0.5 indicates full confusion).", 
        "218": "The i-CNN network keeps improving in terms of implicit relation classification accuracy, as it is gradually fitting to the data and simultaneously learning increasingly discriminative features by mimicking a-CNN.", 
        "219": "The system exhibits similar learning patterns in the two different settings, showing the stability of the training strategy.", 
        "220": "We finally visualize the output feature vectors of i-CNN and a-CNN using the t-SNE method (Maaten and Hinton, 2008) in Figure 5.", 
        "221": "Without feature imitation, the extracted features by the two networks are clearly separated (Figure 5(a)).", 
        "222": "In contrast, as shown in Figures 5(b)(c), the feature vectors are increasingly mixed as training proceeds.", 
        "223": "Thus our framework has suc-\ncessfully driven i-CNN to induce similar representations with a-CNN, even though connectives are not present.", 
        "224": "5 Discussions  We have developed an adversarial neural framework that facilitates an implicit relation network to extract highly discriminative features by mimicking a connective-augmented network.", 
        "225": "Our method achieved state-of-the-art performance for implicit discourse relation classification.", 
        "226": "Besides implicit connective examples, our model can naturally exploit enormous explicit connective data to further improve discourse parsing.", 
        "227": "The proposed adversarial feature imitation scheme is also generally applicable to other context to incorporate indicative side information\navailable at training time for enhanced inference.", 
        "228": "Our framework shares a similar spirit of the iterative knowledge distillation method (Hu et al., 2016a,b) which train a \u201cstudent\u201d network to mimic the classification behavior of a knowledgeinformed \u201cteacher\u201d network.", 
        "229": "Our approach encourages imitation on the feature level instead of the final prediction level.", 
        "230": "This allows our approach to apply to regression tasks, and more interestingly, the context in which the student and teacher networks have different prediction outputs, e.g., performing different tasks, while transferring knowledge between each other can be beneficial.", 
        "231": "Besides, our adversarial mechanism provides an adaptive metric to measure and drive the imitation procedure."

        "101": "3.2.1 Mono-lingual Attention  To address the wrong-labelling issue in distant supervision, we follow the idea of sentence-level attention (Lin et al., 2016) and set mono-lingual attention for MNRE.",

        "171": "From the table we find that, although all of the four sentences actually express the fact that Barzun was born in France, the first and third sentences contain much more noisy information that may confuse RE systems.", 
        "172": "By considering pattern consistency between sentences in two languages with cross-lingual attention, MNRE can identify the second and fourth sentences that unambiguously express the relation PlaceOfBirth with higher attention as compared to CNN+Zh and CNN+En.", 
        "173": "4.4 Effectiveness of Complementarity  To demonstrate the effectiveness of considering pattern complementarity among languages, we empirically compare the following methods through held-out evaluation: MNRE for English (MNRE-En) and MNRE for Chinese (MNRE-Zh) which only use the mono-lingual vectors to predict relations, and [P]CNN-En and [P]CNN-Zh models.", 
        "174": "Fig.", 
        "175": "3 shows the aggregated precision/recall curves of the four models for both CNN and PCNN.", 
        "176": "From the figure, we find that:\n(1) MNRE-En and MNRE-Zh outperform [P]CNN-En and [P]CNN-Zh almost in entire range of recall.", 
        "177": "It indicates that by jointly training with multi-lingual attention, both Chinese and English relation extractors are beneficial from those sentences from the other language.", 
        "178": "(2) Although [P]CNN-En underperforms as compared to [P]CNN-Zh, MNRE-En is comparable to MNRE-Zh by jointly training through multilingual attention.", 
        "179": "It demonstrates that both Chi-\nnese and English relation extractors can take full advantages of texts in both languages via our propose multi-lingual attention scheme.", 
        "180": "Table 5 shows the detailed results (in precision@1) of some specific relations of which the training instances are un-balanced on English and Chinese sides.", 
        "181": "From the table, we can see that:\n(1) For the relation Contains of which the number of English training instances is only 1/7 of Chinese ones, CNN-En gets much worse performance as compared to CNN-Zh due to the lack of training data.", 
        "182": "Nevertheless, by jointly training through multi-lingual attention, MNRE(CNN)En is comparable to and slightly better than\nMNRE(CNN)-Zh.", 
        "183": "(2) For the relation HeadquartersLocation of which the number of Chinese training instances is only 1/9 of English ones, CNN-Zh even cannot predict any correct results.", 
        "184": "The reason is perhaps that, CNN-Zh of the relation is not sufficiently trained because there are only 210 Chinese training instances for this relation.", 
        "185": "Similarly, by jointly training through multi-lingual attention, MNRE(CNN)-En and MNRE(CNN)-Zh both achieve promising results.", 
        "186": "(3) For the relations Father and CountryOfCitizenship of which the sentence number in English and Chinese are not so un-balanced, our MNRE can still improve the performance of relation extraction on both English and Chinese sides.", 
        "187": "4.5 Comparison of Relation Matrix  For relation prediction, we use two kinds of relation matrices including: M that considers the global consistency of relations, and R that considers the specific characteristics of relations for each language.", 
        "188": "To measure the effect of the two relation matrices, we compare the performance of MNRE using the both matrices with those only using M (MNRE-M) and only using R (MNRE-R).", 
        "189": "Fig.", 
        "190": "4 shows the precision-recall curves for each\nmethod.", 
        "191": "From the figure, we observe that:t\n(1) The performance of MNRE-M is much worse than both MNRE-R and MNRE.", 
        "192": "It indicates that we cannot just use global relation matrix for relation prediction.", 
        "193": "The reason is that each language has its own specific characteristics to express relation patterns, which cannot be well integrated into a single relation matrix.", 
        "194": "(2) MNRE(CNN)-R has similar performance as compared to MNRE(CNN) when the recall is low.", 
        "195": "However, it has a sharp decline when the recall reaches 0.25.", 
        "196": "It suggests there also exists global consistency of relation patterns among languages which cannot be neglected.", 
        "197": "Hence, we should combine both M and R together for multi-lingual relation extraction, as proposed in our MNRE\nframework.", 
        "198": "5 Conclusion  In this paper, we introduce a neural relation extraction framework with multi-lingual attention to take pattern consistency and complementarity among multiple languages into consideration.", 
        "199": "We evaluate our framework onmulti-lingual relation extraction task, and the results show that our framework can effectively model relation patterns among languages and achieve state-of-the-art results.", 
        "200": "We will explore the following directions as future work: (1) In this paper, we only consider sentence-level multi-lingual attention for relation extraction.", 
        "201": "In fact, we find that the word alignment information may be also helpful for capturing relation patterns.", 
        "202": "Hence, the word-level multi-lingual attention, which may discover implicit alignments between words in multiple languages, will further improve multi-lingual relation extraction.", 
        "203": "We will explore the effectiveness of word-level multilingual attention for relation extraction as our fu-\nture work.", 
        "204": "(2) MNRE can be flexibly implemented in the scenario of multiple languages, and this paper focuses on two languages of English and Chinese.", 
        "205": "In future, we will extendMNRE to more languages and explore its significance.",

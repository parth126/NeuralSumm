        "6": "A merit of the two-stage approach is that it creates reusable intermediate interpretations, which potentially enables the handling of unseen words and knowledge transfer across domains (Bender et al., 2015).", 
        "7": "The successful application of encoder-decoder models (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Sutskever et al., 2014) to a variety of NLP tasks has provided strong impetus to treat semantic parsing as a sequence transduction problem where an utterance is mapped to a target meaning representation in string format (Dong and Lapata, 2016; Jia and Liang, 2016; Koc\u030cisky\u0301 et al., 2016).", 
        "8": "Such models still fall under the first approach, however, in contrast to previous work (Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Liang et al., 2011) they reduce the need for domain-specific assumptions, grammar learning, and more generally extensive feature engineering.", 
        "9": "But this modeling flexibility comes at a cost since it is no longer possible to interpret how meaning composition is performed.", 
        "10": "Such knowledge plays a critical role in understand modeling limitations so as to build better semantic parsers.", 
        "11": "Moreover, without any taskspecific prior knowledge, the learning problem is fairly unconstrained, both in terms of the possible derivations to consider and in terms of the target output which can be ill-formed (e.g., with extra or missing brackets).", 
        "12": "In this work, we propose a neural semantic parser that alleviates the aforementioned problems.", 
        "13": "Our model falls under the second class of approaches where utterances are first mapped to an intermediate representation containing natural language predicates.", 
        "14": "However, rather than using an external parser (Reddy et al., 2014, 2016) or manually specified CCG grammars (Kwiatkowski et al., 2013), we induce intermediate representations in the form of predicate-argument structures\n44\nfrom data.", 
        "15": "This is achieved with a transition-based approach which by design yields recursive semantic structures, avoiding the problem of generating ill-formed meaning representations.", 
        "16": "Compared to most existing semantic parsers which employ a CKY style bottom-up parsing strategy (Krishnamurthy and Mitchell, 2012; Cai and Yates, 2013; Berant et al., 2013; Berant and Liang, 2014), the transition-based approach we proposed does not require feature decomposition over structures and thereby enables the exploration of rich, non-local features.", 
        "17": "The output of the transition system is then grounded (e.g., to a knowledge base) with a neural mapping model under the assumption that grounded and ungrounded structures are isomorphic.2 As a result, we obtain a neural model that jointly learns to parse natural language semantics and induce a lexicon that helps grounding.",

        "19": "We conduct experiments on four datasets, including GEOQUERY (which has logical forms; Zelle and Mooney 1996), SPADES (Bisk et al., 2016), WEBQUESTIONS (Berant et al., 2013), and GRAPHQUESTIONS (Su et al., 2016) (which have denotations).", 
        "20": "Our semantic parser achieves the state of the art on SPADES and GRAPHQUESTIONS, while obtaining competitive results on GEOQUERY and WEBQUESTIONS.", 
        "21": "A side-product of our modeling framework is that the induced intermediate representations can contribute to rationalizing neural predictions (Lei et al., 2016).",

        "28": "FunQL is a variable-free query language, where each predicate is treated as a function symbol that modifies an argument list.", 
        "29": "For example, the FunQL representation for the utterance which states do not border texas is:\nanswer(exclude(state(all), next to(texas)))\nwhere next to is a domain-specific binary predicate that takes one argument (i.e., the entity texas) and returns a set of entities (e.g., the states bordering Texas) as its denotation.", 
        "30": "all is a special predicate that returns a collection of entities.", 
        "31": "exclude is a predicate that returns the difference between two input sets.",

        "33": "This property makes FunQL logical forms convenient to be predicted with recurrent neural networks (Vinyals et al., 2015; Choe and Charniak, 2016; Dyer et al., 2016).", 
        "34": "However, FunQL is less expressive than lambda calculus, partially due to the elimination of variables.", 
        "35": "A more compact logical formulation which our method also applies to is \u03bb-DCS (Liang, 2013).", 
        "36": "In the absence of anaphora and composite binary predicates, conversion algorithms exist between FunQL and \u03bb-DCS.",

        "44": "Finally, note that for certain domain-general predicates, it also makes sense to extract natural language rationales (e.g., not is indicative for exclude).", 
        "45": "But we do not find this helpful in experiments.",

        "49": "The semantic parsing task is decomposed in two stages: we first explain how an utterance is converted to an intermediate representation (Section 3.1), and then describe how it is grounded to a knowledge base (Section 3.2).", 
        "50": "3.1 Generating Ungrounded Representations  At this stage, utterances are mapped to intermediate representations with a transition-based algorithm.", 
        "51": "In general, the transition system generates the representation by following a derivation tree (which contains a set of applied rules) and some canonical generation order (e.g., depth-first).", 
        "52": "For FunQL, a simple solution exists since the representation itself encodes the derivation.", 
        "53": "Consider again answer(exclude(states(all), border(texas))) which is tree structured.", 
        "54": "Each predicate (e.g., border) can be visualized as a non-terminal node of the tree and each entity (e.g., texas) as a terminal.", 
        "55": "The predicate all is a special case which acts as a terminal directly.", 
        "56": "We can generate the tree with a top-down, depth first transition system reminiscent of recurrent neural network grammars (RNNGs; Dyer et al.", 
        "57": "2016).", 
        "58": "Similar to RNNG, our\nalgorithm uses a buffer to store input tokens in the utterance and a stack to store partially completed trees.", 
        "59": "A major difference in our semantic parsing scenario is that tokens in the buffer are not fetched in a sequential order or removed from the buffer.", 
        "60": "This is because the lexical alignment between an utterance and its semantic representation is hidden.", 
        "61": "Moreover, some predicates cannot be clearly anchored to a token span.", 
        "62": "Therefore, we allow the generation algorithm to pick tokens and combine logical forms in arbitrary orders, conditioning on the entire set of sentential features.", 
        "63": "Alternative solutions in the traditional semantic parsing literature include a floating chart parser (Pasupat and Liang, 2015) which allows to construct logical predicates out of thin air.", 
        "64": "Our transition system defines three actions, namely NT, TER, and RED, explained below.", 
        "65": "NT(X) generates a Non-Terminal predicate.", 
        "66": "This predicate is either a natural language expression such as border, or one of the domain-general predicates exemplified in Table 1 (e.g., exclude).", 
        "67": "The type of predicate is determined by the placeholder X and once generated, it is pushed onto the stack and represented as a non-terminal followed by an open bracket (e.g., \u2018border(\u2019).", 
        "68": "The open bracket will be closed by a reduce operation.", 
        "69": "TER(X) generates a TERminal entity or the special predicate all.", 
        "70": "Note that the terminal choice does not include variable (e.g., $0, $1), since FunQL is a variable-free language which sufficiently captures the semantics of the datasets we work with.", 
        "71": "The framework could be extended to generate directly acyclic graphs by incorporating variables with additional transition actions for handling variable mentions and co-reference.", 
        "72": "RED stands for REDuce and is used for subtree completion.", 
        "73": "It recursively pops elements from the stack until an open non-terminal node is encountered.", 
        "74": "The non-terminal is popped as well, after which a composite term representing the entire subtree, e.g., border(texas), is pushed back to the stack.", 
        "75": "If a RED action results in having no more open non-terminals left on the stack, the transition system terminates.", 
        "76": "Table 2 shows the transition actions used to generate our running example.", 
        "77": "The model generates the ungrounded representation U conditioned on utterance x by recursively calling one of the above three actions.", 
        "78": "Note that U is defined by a sequence of actions (denoted\nby a) and a sequence of term choices (denoted by u) as shown in Table 2.",

        "80": "To predict the actions of the transition system, we encode the input buffer with a bidirectional LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) and the output stack with a stack-LSTM (Dyer et al., 2015).", 
        "81": "At each time step, the model uses the representation of the transition system et to predict an action:\np(at|a<t, x) \u221d exp(Wa \u00b7 et) (2)\nwhere et is the concatenation of the buffer representation bt and the stack representation st.", 
        "82": "While the stack representation st is easy to retrieve as the top state of the stack-LSTM, obtaining the buffer representation bt is more involved.", 
        "83": "This is because we do not have an explicit buffer representation due to the non-projectivity of semantic parsing.", 
        "84": "We therefore compute at each time step an adaptively weighted representation of bt (Bahdanau et al., 2015) conditioned on the stack representation st.", 
        "85": "This buffer representation is then concatenated with the stack representation to form the system representation et.", 
        "86": "When the predicted action is either NT or TER, an ungrounded term ut (either a predicate or an\nentity) needs to be chosen from the candidate list depending on the specific placeholder X.",

        "88": "For the choice of composition function, we use a single-layer neural network as in Dyer et al.", 
        "89": "(2015), which takes as input the concatenated representation of the predicate and argument of the subtree.", 
        "90": "3.2 Generating Grounded Representations  Since we constrain the network to learn ungrounded structures that are isomorphic to the target meaning representation, converting ungrounded representations to grounded ones becomes a simple lexical mapping problem.", 
        "91": "For simplicity, hereafter we do not differentiate natural language and domain-general predicates.", 
        "92": "To map an ungrounded term ut to a grounded term gt, we compute the conditional probability\nof gt given ut with a bi-linear neural network: p(gt|ut) \u221d exp ~ut \u00b7Wug \u00b7 ~gt> (5) where ~ut is the contextual representation of the ungrounded term given by the bidirectional LSTM, ~gt is the grounded term embedding, and Wug is the weight matrix.", 
        "93": "The above grounding step can be interpreted as learning a lexicon: the model exclusively relies on the intermediate representation U to predict the target meaning representation G without taking into account any additional features based on the utterance.", 
        "94": "In practice, U may provide sufficient contextual background for closed domain semantic parsing where an ungrounded predicate often maps to a single grounded predicate, but is a relatively impoverished representation for parsing large open-domain knowledge bases like Freebase.", 
        "95": "In this case, we additionally rely on a discriminative reranker which ranks the grounded representations derived from ungrounded representations (see Section 3.4).", 
        "96": "3.3 Training Objective  When the target meaning representation is available, we directly compare it against our predictions and back-propagate.",

        "156": "(2016) evaluate the effectiveness of four different CCG parsers on the semantic parsing task when varying the amount of supervision required.", 
        "157": "As can be seen, SCANNER outperforms all CCG variants (from unsupervised to fully supervised) without having access to any manually annotated derivations or lexicons.", 
        "158": "For fair comparison, we also built a neural baseline that encodes an utterance with a recurrent neural network and then predicts a grounded meaning representation directly (Ture and Jojic, 2016; Yih et al., 2016).", 
        "159": "Again, we observe that SCANNER outperforms this baseline.", 
        "160": "Results on WEBQUESTIONS are summarized in Table 3.", 
        "161": "SCANNER obtains performance on par with the best symbolic systems (see the first block in the table).", 
        "162": "It is important to note that Bast and Haussmann (2015) develop a question answering system, which contrary to ours can-\nnot produce meaning representations whereas Berant and Liang (2015) propose a sophisticated agenda-based parser which is trained borrowing ideas from imitation learning.", 
        "163": "SCANNER is conceptually similar to Reddy et al.", 
        "164": "(2016) who also learn a semantic parser via intermediate representations which they generate based on the output of a dependency parser.", 
        "165": "SCANNER performs competitively despite not having access to any linguistically-informed syntactic structures.", 
        "166": "The second block in Table 3 reports the results of several neural systems.", 
        "167": "Xu et al.", 
        "168": "(2016) represent the state of the art on WEBQUESTIONS.", 
        "169": "Their system uses Wikipedia to prune out erroneous candidate answers extracted from Freebase.", 
        "170": "Our model would also benefit from a similar post-processing step.", 
        "171": "As in previous experiments, SCANNER outperforms the neural baseline, too.", 
        "172": "Finally, Table 4 presents our results on GRAPHQUESTIONS.", 
        "173": "We report F1 for SCANNER, the neural baseline model, and three symbolic systems presented in Su et al.", 
        "174": "(2016).", 
        "175": "SCANNER achieves a new state of the art on this dataset with a gain of 4.23 F1 points over the best previously reported model.", 
        "176": "4.4 Analysis of Intermediate Representations  Since a central feature of our parser is that it learns intermediate representations with natural language predicates, we conducted additional experiments in order to inspect their quality.", 
        "177": "For GEOQUERY\nwhich contains only 280 test examples, we manually annotated intermediate representations for the test instances and evaluated the learned representations against them.", 
        "178": "The experimental setup aims to shows how humans can participate in improving the semantic parser with feedback at the intermediate stage.", 
        "179": "In terms of evaluation, we use three metrics shown in Table 7.", 
        "180": "The first row shows the percentage of exact matches between the predicted representations and the human annotations.", 
        "181": "The second row refers to the percentage of structure matches, where the predicted representations have the same structure as the human annotations, but may not use the same lexical terms.", 
        "182": "Among structurally correct predictions, we additionally compute how many tokens are correct, as shown in the third row.", 
        "183": "As can be seen, the induced meaning representations overlap to a large extent with the human gold standard.", 
        "184": "We also evaluated the intermediate representations created by SCANNER on the other three (Freebase) datasets.", 
        "185": "Since creating a manual gold standard for these large datasets is time-consuming, we compared the induced representations against the output of a syntactic parser.", 
        "186": "Specifically, we converted the questions to event-argument structures with EASYCCG (Lewis and Steedman, 2014), a high coverage and high accuracy CCG parser.", 
        "187": "EASYCCG extracts predicate-argument structures with a labeled F-score of 83.37%.", 
        "188": "For further comparison, we built a simple baseline which identifies predicates based on the output of the Stanford POStagger (Manning et al., 2014) following the ordering VBD VBN VB VBP VBZ MD.", 
        "189": "As shown in Table 8, on SPADES and WEBQUESTIONS, the predicates learned by our model match the output of EASYCCG more closely than the heuristic baseline.", 
        "190": "But for GRAPHQUESTIONS which contains more compositional questions, the mismatch is higher.", 
        "191": "However, since the key idea of our model is to capture salient meaning for the task at hand rather than strictly obey syntax, we would not expect the\npredicates induced by our system to entirely agree with those produced by the syntactic parser.", 
        "192": "To further analyze how the learned predicates differ from syntax-based ones, we grouped utterances in SPADES into four types of linguistic constructions: coordination (conj), control and raising (control), prepositional phrase attachment (pp), and subordinate clauses (subord).", 
        "193": "Table 8 also shows the breakdown of matching scores per linguistic construction, with the number of utterances in each type.", 
        "194": "In Table 9, we provide examples of predicates identified by SCANNER, indicating whether they agree or not with the output of EASYCCG.", 
        "195": "As a reminder, the task in SPADES is to predict the entity masked by a blank symbol ( ).", 
        "196": "As can be seen in Table 8, the matching score is relatively high for utterances involving coordination and prepositional phrase attachments.", 
        "197": "The model will often identify informative predicates (e.g., nouns) which do not necessarily agree with linguistic intuition.", 
        "198": "For example, in the utterance wilhelm maybach and his son started maybach in 1909 (see Table 9), SCANNER identifies the predicateargument structure son(wilhelm maybach) rather than started(wilhelm maybach).", 
        "199": "We also observed that the model struggles with control and subordinate constructions.", 
        "200": "It has difficulty distinguishing control from raising predicates as exemplified in the utterance ceo john thain agreed to leave from Table 9, where it identifies the raising predicate agreed.", 
        "201": "For subordinate clauses, SCANNER tends to take shortcuts identifying as predicates words closest to the blank symbol.", 
        "202": "5 Discussion  We presented a neural semantic parser which converts natural language utterances to grounded meaning representations via intermediate predicate-argument structures.", 
        "203": "Our model\nessentially jointly learns how to parse natural language semantics and the lexicons that help grounding.", 
        "204": "Compared to previous neural semantic parsers, our model is more interpretable as the intermediate structures are useful for inspecting what the model has learned and whether it matches linguistic intuition.", 
        "205": "An assumption our model imposes is that ungrounded and grounded representations are structurally isomorphic.", 
        "206": "An advantage of this assumption is that tokens in the ungrounded and grounded representations are strictly aligned.", 
        "207": "This allows the neural network to focus on parsing and lexical mapping, sidestepping the challenging structure mapping problem which would result in a larger search space and higher variance.", 
        "208": "On the negative side, the structural isomorphism assumption restricts the expressiveness of the model, especially since one of the main benefits of adopting a two-stage parser is the potential of capturing domain-independent semantic information via the intermediate representation.", 
        "209": "While it would be challenging to handle drastically non-isomorphic structures in the current model, it is possible to perform local structure matching, i.e., when the mapping between natural language and domainspecific predicates is many-to-one or one-to-many.", 
        "210": "For instance, Freebase does not contain a relation representing daughter, using instead two relations representing female and child.", 
        "211": "Previous work (Kwiatkowski et al., 2013) models such cases by introducing collapsing (for many-to-one mapping) and expansion (for one-to-many mapping) operators.", 
        "212": "Within our current framework, these two types of structural mismatches can be handled with semi-Markov assumptions (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2005; Kong et al., 2016) in the parsing (i.e., predicate selection) and the grounding steps, respectively.", 
        "213": "Aside from relaxing strict isomorphism, we would also like to perform crossdomain semantic parsing where the first stage of the semantic parser is shared across domains.", 
        "214": "Acknowledgments We would like to thank three anonymous reviewers, members of the Edinburgh ILCC and the IBM Watson, and Abulhair Saparov for feedback.",

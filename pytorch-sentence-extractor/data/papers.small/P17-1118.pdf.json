        "11": "1 Introduction  Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) can affect one or multiple cognitive domains (e.g.", 
        "12": "memory, language, visuospatial skills and executive functions), and may represent a pre-clinical stage of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD).", 
        "13": "The impairment that affects memory, referred to as amnestic MCI, is the most frequent, with the highest conversion rate for AD, at 15% per year versus 1 to 2% for the general population.", 
        "14": "Since dementias are chronic and progressive diseases, their early diagnosis ensures a greater chance of success to engage patients in non-pharmacological treatment strategies such as cognitive training, physical activity and socialization (Teixeira et al., 2012).", 
        "15": "Language is one of the most efficient information sources to assess cognitive functions.", 
        "16": "Changes in language usage are frequent in patients with dementia and are normally first recognized by the patients themselves or their family members.", 
        "17": "Therefore, the automatic analysis of discourse production is promising in diagnosing MCI at early stages, which may address potentially reversible factors (Muangpaisan et al., 2012).", 
        "18": "Proposals to detect language-related impairment in dementias include machine learning (Jarrold et al., 2010; Roark et al., 2011; Fraser et al., 2014, 2015), magnetic resonance imaging (Dyrba et al., 2015), and data screening tests added to demographic information (Weakley et al., 2015).", 
        "19": "Discourse production (mainly narratives) is attractive because it allows the analysis of linguistic microstructures, including phonetic-phonological, morphosyntactic and semantic-lexical components, as well as semantic-pragmatic macrostructures.", 
        "20": "Automated discourse analysis based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) resources and tools to diagnose dementias via machine learning methods has been used for English language (Lehr et al.,\n1284\n2012; Jarrold et al., 2014; Orimaye et al., 2014; Fraser et al., 2015; Davy et al., 2016) and for Brazilian Portuguese (Alu\u0131\u0301sio et al., 2016).", 
        "21": "A variety of features are required for this analysis, including Part-of-Speech (PoS), syntactic complexity, lexical diversity and acoustic features.", 
        "22": "Producing robust tools to extract these features is extremely difficult because speech transcripts used in neuropsychological evaluations contain disfluencies (repetitions, revisions, paraphasias) and patient\u2019s comments about the task being evaluated.", 
        "23": "Another problem in using linguistic knowledge is the high dependence on manually created resources, such as hand-crafted linguistic rules and/or annotated corpora.", 
        "24": "Even when traditional statistical techniques (Bag of Words or ngrams) are applied, problems still appear in dealing with disfluencies, because mispronounced words will not be counted together.", 
        "25": "Indeed, other types of disfluencies (repetition, amendments, patient\u2019s comments about the task) will be counted, thus increasing the vocabulary.", 
        "26": "An approach applied successfully to several areas of NLP (Mihalcea and Radev, 2011), which may suffer less from the problems mentioned above, relies on the use of complex networks and graph theory.", 
        "27": "The word adjacency network model (i Cancho and Sole\u0301, 2001; Roxas and Tapang, 2010; Amancio et al., 2012a; Amancio, 2015b) has provided good results in text classification (de Arruda et al., 2016) and related tasks, namely author detection (Amancio, 2015a), identification of literary movements (Amancio et al., 2012c), authenticity verification (Amancio et al., 2013) and word sense discrimination (Amancio et al., 2012b).", 
        "28": "In this paper, we show that speech transcripts (narratives or descriptions) can be modeled into complex networks that are enriched with word embedding in order to better represent short texts produced in these assessments.", 
        "29": "When applied to a machine learning classifier, the complex network features were able to distinguish between control participants and mild cognitive impairment participants.", 
        "30": "Discrimination of the two classes could be improved by combining complex networks with linguistic and traditional statistical features.", 
        "31": "With regard to the task of detecting MCI from transcripts, this paper is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to: a) show that classifiers using features extracted from transcripts modeled into\ncomplex networks enriched with word embedding present higher accuracy than using only complex networks for 3 datasets; and b) show that for languages that do not have competitive dependency and constituency parsers to exploit syntactic features, e.g.",

        "33": "2 Related Work  Detection of memory impairment has been based on linguistic, acoustic, and demographic features, in addition to scores of neuropsychological tests.", 
        "34": "Linguistic and acoustic features were used to automatically detect aphasia (Fraser et al., 2014); and AD (Fraser et al., 2015) or dementia (Orimaye et al., 2014) in the public corpora of DementiaBank1.",

        "50": "For the Portuguese language, machine learning 1talkbank.org/DementiaBank/\nalgorithms were used to identify subjects with AD and MCI.", 
        "51": "Alu\u0131\u0301sio et al.", 
        "52": "(2016) used a variety of linguistic metrics, such as syntactic complexity, idea density (da Cunha et al., 2015), and text cohesion through latent semantics.", 
        "53": "NLP tools with high precision are needed to compute these metrics, which is a problem for Portuguese since no robust dependency or constituency parsers exist.", 
        "54": "Therefore, the transcriptions had to be manually revised; they were segmented into sentences, following a semantic-structural criterion and capitalization was applied.", 
        "55": "The authors also removed disfluencies and inserted omitted subjects when they were hidden, in order to reduce parsing errors.", 
        "56": "This process is obviously expensive, which has motivated us to use complex networks in the present study to model transcriptions and avoid a manual preprocessing step.", 
        "57": "3 Modeling and Characterizing Texts as Complex Networks  The theory and concepts of complex networks have been used in several NLP tasks (Mihalcea and Radev, 2011; Cong and Liu, 2014), such as text classification (de Arruda et al., 2016), summarization (Antiqueira et al., 2009; Amancio et al., 2012a) and word sense disambiguation (Silva and Amancio, 2012).", 
        "58": "In this study, we used the word co-occurrence model (also called word adjacency model) because most of the syntactical relations occur among neighboring words (i Cancho et al., 2004).", 
        "59": "Each distinct word becomes a node and words that are adjacent in the text are connected by an edge.", 
        "60": "Mathematically, a network is defined as an undirected graph G = {V,E}, formed by a set V = {v1, v2, ..., vn} of nodes (words) and a set E = {e1, e2, ..., em} of edges (co-occurrence) that are represented by an adjacency matrix A, whose elements Aij are equal to 1 whenever there is an edge connecting nodes (words) i and j, and equal to 0 otherwise.", 
        "61": "Before modeling texts into complex networks, it is often necessary to do some preprocessing in the raw text.", 
        "62": "Preprocessing starts with tokenization where each document/text is divided into tokens (meaningful elements, e.g., words and punctuation marks) and then stopwords and punctuation marks are removed, since they have little semantic meaning.", 
        "63": "One last step we decided to eliminate from the preprocessing pipeline is lemmatization, which transforms each word into its canonical\nform.", 
        "64": "This decision was made based on two factors.", 
        "65": "First, a recent work has shown that lemmatization has little or no influence when network modeling is adopted in related tasks (Machicao et al., 2016).", 
        "66": "Second, the lemmatization process requires part-of-speech (POS) tagging that may introduce undesirable noises/errors in the text, since the transcriptions in our work contain disfluencies.", 
        "67": "Another problem with transcriptions in our work is their size.", 
        "68": "As demonstrated by Amancio (2015c), classification of small texts using networks can be impaired, since short texts have almost linear networks, and the topological measures of these networks have little or no information relevant to classification.", 
        "69": "To solve this problem, we adapted the approach of inducing language networks from word embeddings, proposed by Perozzi et al.", 
        "70": "(2014) to enrich the networks with semantic information.", 
        "71": "In their work, language networks were generated from continuous word representations, in which each word is represented by a dense, real-valued vector obtained by training neural networks in the language model task (or variations, such as context prediction) (Bengio et al., 2003; Collobert et al., 2011; Mikolov et al., 2013a,b).", 
        "72": "This structure is known to capture syntactic and semantic information.", 
        "73": "Perozzi et al.", 
        "74": "(2014), in particular, take advantage of word embeddings to build networks where each word is\na vertex and edges are defined by similarity between words established by the proximity of the word vectors.", 
        "75": "Following this methodology, in our model we added new edges to the co-occurrence networks considering similarities between words, that is, for all pairs of words in the text that were not connected, an edge was created if their vectors (from word embedding) had a cosine similarity higher than a given threshold.", 
        "76": "Figure 1 shows an example of a co-occurrence network enriched by similarity links (the dotted edges).", 
        "77": "The gain in information by enriching a co-occurrence network with semantic information is readily apparent in Figure 2.", 
        "78": "4 Datasets, Features and Methods    4.1 Datasets  The datasets2 used in our study consisted of: (i) manually segmented and transcribed samples from the DementiaBank and Cinderella story and (ii) transcribed samples of Arizona Battery for Communication Disorders of Dementia (ABCD) automatically segmented into sentences, since we are working towards a fully automated system to detect MCI in transcripts and would like to evaluate a dataset which was automatically processed.",

        "168": "This approach is an elegant solution in comparison to combining all features in the same vector or space, for two main reasons.", 
        "169": "First, combination is not a straightforward step and may lead to noise insertion since the data have different natures.", 
        "170": "Second, using different classifiers for each feature space allows for different weights to be given for each type of feature, and these weights can be learned by a regression method to improve the model.",

        "174": "The evaluation was performed using 5-fold cross-validation instead of the well-accepted 10-fold cross-validation because the datasets in our study were small and the test set would have shrunk, leading to less precise measurements of accuracy.",

        "183": "In general, CNE outperforms the approach using only complex networks (CN), while SVM (Linear or RBF kernel) provides higher accuracy than other machine learning algorithms.", 
        "184": "The results for the three datasets show that characterizing transcriptions into complex networks is competitive with other traditional methods, such as the use of linguistic metrics.", 
        "185": "In fact, among the three types of features, using enriched networks (CNE) provided the highest accuracies in two datasets (Cookie Theft and original Cinderella).",

        "195": "To the best of our knowledge, these metrics have never been used to detect MCI in speech transcripts; CN were enriched with word embeddings to better represent short texts produced in neuropsychological assessments.", 
        "196": "The topological properties of CN outperform traditional linguistic metrics in individual classifiers\u2019 results.", 
        "197": "Linguistic features depend on grammatical texts to present good results, as can be seen in the results of the manually processed Cinderella dataset (Table 7).", 
        "198": "Furthermore, we found that combining machine and multi-view learning can improve accuracy.", 
        "199": "The accuracies found here are comparable to the values reported by other authors, ranging from 60% to 85% (Prud\u2019hommeaux and Roark, 2011; Lehr et al., 2012; To\u0301th et al., 2015; Vincze et al., 2016), which means that it is not easy to distinguish between healthy subjects and those with cognitive impairments.", 
        "200": "The comparison with our results is not straightforward, though, because the databases used in the studies are different.", 
        "201": "There is a clear need for publicly available datasets to compare different methods, which would optimize the detection of MCI in elderly people.", 
        "202": "In future work, we intend to explore other methods to enrich CN, such as the Recurrent Language Model, and use other metrics to characterize an adjacency network.", 
        "203": "The pursuit of these strategies is relevant because language is one of the most efficient information sources to evaluate cognitive functions, commonly used in neuropsychological assessments.", 
        "204": "As this work is ongoing, we will keep collecting new transcriptions of the ABCD retelling subtest to increase the corpus size and obtain more reliable results in our studies.", 
        "205": "Our final goal is to apply neuropsychological assessment batteries, such as the ABCD retelling subtest, to mobile devices, specifically tablets.",

        "51": "While the model may be somewhat more difficult to optimize using attention, it provides the added benefit of interpretability, as the weights highlight to what extent the classifier considers the LSTM state vectors at each token during modeling.",

        "79": "When attention is turned off, this yields an absolute decrease in performance of 2.70% on the test set, which is substantial and significant according to a Welch two-sample t-test (p < .001).", 
        "80": "Second, we independently compare the use of the partial sampling scheme against training on the standard argument pairs in the CDTB.", 
        "81": "Here, the absence of the partial sampling scheme yields an absolute decrease in accuracy of 5.74% (p < .001), which demonstrates its importance for achieving competitive performance on the task.", 
        "82": "Performance on the PDTB: As a side experiment, we investigate the model\u2019s language independence by applying it to the implicit argument pairs of the English PDTB.", 
        "83": "Due to computational time constraints we do not optimize hyperparameters, but instead train the model using identical settings as for Chinese, which is expected to lead to suboptimal performance on the evaluation data.", 
        "84": "Nevertheless, we measure 27.09% accuracy on the PDTB test set (surpassing the majority class baseline of 22.01%), which shows that the model has potential to generalize across implicit discourse relations in a different language.",

        "87": "Most ENTRELs show an opposite trend: here second arguments exhibit larger intensities than Arg1, as most entity relations follow the characteristic writing style of newspapers by adding additional information by reference to the same entity.", 
        "88": "4 Summary & Outlook  In this work, we have presented the first attentionbased recurrent neural sense labeler specifically developed for Chinese implicit discourse relations.", 
        "89": "Its ability to model discourse units sequentially and jointly has been shown to be highly beneficial, both in terms of state-of-the-art performance on the CDTB (outperforming word order-agnostic feedforward approaches), and also in terms of insightful observations into the inner workings of the model through its attention mechanism.", 
        "90": "The architecture is structurally simple, benefits from partial argument sampling, and can be eas-\nily adapted to similar relation recognition tasks.", 
        "91": "In future work, we intend to extend our approach to different languages and domains, e.g., to the recent data sets on narrative story understanding or question answering (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016; Feng et al., 2015).",

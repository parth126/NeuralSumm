        "47": "Furthermore, past work on the topic seems to indicate that this differentia-\ntion improves overall performance (Tourille et al., 2016).", 
        "48": "We have adopted this approach by building two separate classifiers, one for intra-sentence relations and one for inter-sentence relations.", 
        "49": "If we were to consider all combinations of entities within documents for inter-sentence relations, it would result in a very large training corpus with very few positive examples.", 
        "50": "In order to cope with this issue, we limit our experiments to intersentence relations that do not span over more than three sentences.", 
        "51": "By doing so, we obtain a manageable training corpus size with less unbalanced classes while keeping a good coverage.", 
        "52": "It results in 2,085 inter-sentences relations for the training corpus and 743 for the test corpus.", 
        "53": "5 Neural Network Model  First, we present the main component of our model in Section 5.1.", 
        "54": "Then, we describe the word embeddings that we use as input for the model in Section 5.2.",

        "57": "The architecture of our model is presented in Figure 2.", 
        "58": "For a given sequence of tokens separating two entities (EVENT and/or TIMEX3), represented as vectors, we compute a representation by going from left to right in the sequence (forward LSTM in figure 2).", 
        "59": "As LSTMs tend to be biased toward the most recent inputs, this implementation would be biased toward the second entity of each pair processed by the network.", 
        "60": "To counteract this effect, we compute the reverse representation with an LSTM reading the sequence backwards, from right to left (backward LSTM in figure 2).", 
        "61": "By doing so, we keep as\nmuch information as possible about the two entities.", 
        "62": "The two final states are then concatenated and linearly transformed to a 3-dimensional vector representing the number of categories (concatenation and projection in figure 2).", 
        "63": "Finally, a softmax function is applied.", 
        "64": "5.2 Input Embeddings  Vectors representing tokens are built by concatenating a character-based embedding, a word embedding, one embedding per Gold Standard attribute and one embedding per cTAKES attribute.", 
        "65": "While the word embedding is a classical option in the context of neural models, the embeddings for Gold Standard and cTAKES attributes are a way of integrating in such model features that have been demonstrated as useful in previous work.", 
        "66": "Finally, temporal clues such as verbs, and more particularly their tense, which are important in assessing if one entity temporally contains another, are taken into account by our character-based representation\nof tokens.", 
        "67": "An overview of the embedding computation is presented in Figure 3.", 
        "68": "Following Lample et al.", 
        "69": "(2016), the character-based representation is constructed with a Bi-LSTM.", 
        "70": "First, a random embedding is generated for every character present in the training corpus.", 
        "71": "Token characters are then processed with a forward and backward LSTM similar to the one we use in our general architecture.", 
        "72": "The final character-based representation is the result of the concatenation of the forward and backward representations.", 
        "73": "We use a character embedding size of 8 and hidden dimensions of 25 for the forward and backward LSTMs, resulting in a final representation size of 50 after concatenation.", 
        "74": "This representation is randomly initialized and incrementally defined by the training of the whole network.", 
        "75": "For word embeddings, our vectors are pretrained by applying word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) on the Mimic 3 corpus (Johnson et al., 2016)1.", 
        "76": "In order to account for unknown tokens during the test phase, we train a special embedding UNK by replacing randomly some singletons with the UNK token (probability of replacement = 0.5).", 
        "77": "1Parameters used during computation: algorithm = CBOW; min-count = 4; vector size = 100; window = 8.", 
        "78": "In the inter-sentence relation classifier, we introduce a specific token for identifying sentence breaks.", 
        "79": "This token is composed of one distinctive character and it is associated to a specific word embedding.", 
        "80": "Similarly to the character embeddings, we randomly initialize one embedding per token attribute value, with an embedding size of 4.", 
        "81": "All these embeddings are then concatenated in a final representation.", 
        "82": "5.3 Network Training  We implemented the network using TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2015).", 
        "83": "We trained our network with mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent using Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a batchsize of 256.", 
        "84": "The learning rate was set to 0.001.", 
        "85": "The hidden layers of our forward and backward LSTMs have a size of 512.", 
        "86": "We kept 10% of the training corpus for a development corpus and we implemented early stopping with a patience of 10 epochs without performance improvement.", 
        "87": "Finally, we used dropout training to avoid overfitting.", 
        "88": "We applied dropout on input embeddings with a rate of 0.5.", 
        "89": "6 Experiments and Discussion  We experimented with three configurations.", 
        "90": "In the first one, we used only word embeddings and character embeddings.", 
        "91": "In the second one, we added the feature embeddings related to the Gold Standard (GS) attributes.", 
        "92": "Finally, in a third experiment, we added the feature embeddings related to cTAKES.", 
        "93": "For each experiment, we report precision (P), recall (R) and F1-measure (F1) computed with the official evaluation script2 provided during the Clinical TempEval challenges.", 
        "94": "Results of the experiments are presented in Table 4.", 
        "95": "For comparison, we report the baseline provided as reference during the Clinical TempEval shared tasks,\n2https://github.com/bethard/ anaforatools\nthe results of the best system of the Clinical TempEval 2016 challenge (Lee et al., 2016) and the best scores obtained after the challenge (Lin et al., 2016) on the test portion of the corpus.",

        "99": "All three of our models perform better in terms of F1-measure than Lee et al.", 
        "100": "(2016) and Lin et al.", 
        "101": "(2016).", 
        "102": "Our two best models also outperform Leeuwenberg and Moens (2017), who report an F-measure of .608 using a structured perceptron.", 
        "103": "Interestingly, their model did not distinguish between intra- and inter- sentence relations, but instead considered that related entities had to occur within a window of 30 tokens.", 
        "104": "We see that the addition of attribute embeddings slightly improves the overall performance of our system (+0.008).", 
        "105": "Adding the embeddings of GS features contributes to the major part of this improvement but tends to increase the imbalance between recall and precision.", 
        "106": "On the contrary, while the attribute embeddings related to cTAKES seem to have little impact on the overall performance, they tend to restore more balanced precision and recall.", 
        "107": "The results for respectively intra- and intersentence relations are presented in Table 3.", 
        "108": "Similarly to our global results, the intra-sentence classifier benefits from the addition of feature embeddings with a small increase for GS features and only a very little improvement for cTAKES features.", 
        "109": "The inter-sentence classifier exhibits the same trend: GS features do improve the performance.", 
        "110": "However, adding cTAKES features degrades it slightly (-0.013).", 
        "111": "The closest work compared to ours is clearly\nDligach et al.", 
        "112": "(2017) as it also heavily relies on neural models for extracting temporal containment relations between medical events.", 
        "113": "Dligach et al.", 
        "114": "(2017) tested both CNN and LSTM models and found CNN superior to LSTM.", 
        "115": "However, this work addressed intra-sentence relations only.", 
        "116": "Moreover, its LSTM model was not a Bi-LSTM model as ours and it did not include characterbased or attribute embeddings.", 
        "117": "Finally, it distinguished EVENT-TIMEX3 and EVENT-EVENT relations while we have only one model for the two types of relations.", 
        "118": "7 Conclusion and Perspectives  From a global perspective, the work we have presented in this article shows that in accordance with a more general trend, our neural model for extracting containment relations clearly outperforms classical approaches based on feature engineering.", 
        "119": "However, it also shows that incorporating classical features in such a model is a way to improve it, even if all kinds of features do not contribute equally to such improvement.", 
        "120": "A more fine-grained study has now to be performed to determine the most meaningful features in this perspective and to measure the contribution of each feature to the overall performance, with a specific emphasis on character-based embeddings.", 
        "121": "Beyond a further analysis of the characteristics of our model, we are interested in two main extensions.", 
        "122": "The first one will investigate whether training two models, one for EVENT-TIMEX3 relations and one for EVENT-EVENT relations, as done by Dligach et al.", 
        "123": "(2017), is a better option than training one model for all types of containment relations as presented herein.", 
        "124": "The second extension consists in transposing the model we have defined in this work for English to French, as done by Tourille et al.", 
        "125": "(2017) for a more traditional approach based on a feature engineering approach.",

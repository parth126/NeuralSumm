        "82": "Another point of complexity in these advertisements is the high number of unigrams, due to usage of uncommon words and obfuscation.",

        "105": "For instance, consider the two unigrams \u201ccash\u201d and \u201c\u00a9a$h.\u201d While these contain different characters, semantically they are the same, and they occur in the same context.", 
        "106": "Thus, our expectation is that both the unigrams will be mapped to similar vectors.", 
        "107": "Word embeddings pretrained on general domains do not cover most of the unigrams in Trafficking-10k.",

        "109": "The first step of the HTDN pipeline is to train word vectors (Mikolov et al., 2013) based on the skip-gram model.", 
        "110": "This is especially suitable for escort ads, because skip-gram models are able to capture context without relying on word order.",

        "193": "Random and Human.", 
        "194": "Random is based on assigning the more frequent class in training set to all the test data, and can be considered a lower bound for our model.", 
        "195": "Human performance metrics are upper bounds for this task\u2019s metrics.", 
        "196": "We visualize the different inputs to our baseline models to show the complexity of the dataset when using different feature sets.", 
        "197": "Figure 4 shows the 2D t-SNE (Maaten and Hinton, 2008) representation of the training data in our dataset according to the Bag-of-Words (top right) models, expert keywords (top left), average word vectors (bottom right), and the visual representation hv bottom left.", 
        "198": "The distribution of points suggests that none of the feature representations make the classification task trivial.", 
        "199": "5.2 Training Parameters  All the models in our experiments are trained on the Trafficking-10k designated training set and tested on the designated test set.", 
        "200": "Hyperparameter evaluation is performed using a subset of training set as validation set.", 
        "201": "The HTDN model is trained using the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014).", 
        "202": "The neural weights were initialized randomly using Xavier initialization technique (Glorot and Bengio, 2010).", 
        "203": "The random forest model uses 10 estimators, with no maximum depth, and minimum-samplesper-split value of 2.", 
        "204": "The linear SVM model uses an `2-penalty and a square hinge loss with C = 1.", 
        "205": "6 Results and Discussion  The results of our experiments are shown in Table 1.", 
        "206": "We report the results on three metrics: F1-score, weighted accuracy, and accuracy.", 
        "207": "Due to the imbalance between the numbers of positive and negative samples, weighted accuracy is more informative than unweighted accuracy, so we focus on the former.", 
        "208": "HTDN.", 
        "209": "The first observation from Table 1 is that the HTDN model outperforms all the proposed baselines.", 
        "210": "There is a significant gap between the HTDN (and variants) and other non-neural approaches.", 
        "211": "This better performance is an indicator of complex interactions in detecting dynamics of human trafficking, which is captured by the HTDN.", 
        "212": "Both Modalities are Helpful.", 
        "213": "Both modalities are helpful in predicting signs of trafficking (Fl and Fv [T-VGG]).", 
        "214": "Fine-tuning VGG network parameters shows improvement over pre-trained VGG parameters.", 
        "215": "Language is More Important.", 
        "216": "Since Fl shows\nbetter performance than Fv [T-VGG], the language modality appears to be the more informative modality for detecting trafficking suspicious ads.", 
        "217": "7 Conclusion and Future Work  In this paper, we took a major step in multimodal modeling of suspected online trafficking advertisements.", 
        "218": "We presented a novel dataset, Trafficking10k, with more than 10,000 advertisements annotated for this task.", 
        "219": "The dataset contains two modalities of information per advertisement: text and images.", 
        "220": "We designed a deep multimodal model called the Human Trafficking Deep Network (HTDN).", 
        "221": "We compared the performance of the HTDN to various models that use language and vision alone.", 
        "222": "The HTDN outperformed all of these, indicating that using information from both sources may be more helpful than using just one.", 
        "223": "Exploring language through character modeling.", 
        "224": "In order to eliminate the need for retraining the word vectors as the language of the domain evolves, we plan to use character models to learn a better language model for trafficking.", 
        "225": "As new obfuscated words are introduced in escort advertisements, our hope is that character models will stay invariant to these obfuscations.", 
        "226": "Understanding images.", 
        "227": "While CNNs have proven to be useful for many different computer vision tasks, we seek to improve the learning capability of the visual network.", 
        "228": "Future direction involves using graphical modeling to understand interactions in the scene.", 
        "229": "Another direction involves working to understand text in images, which can provide more information about the subjects of the images.", 
        "230": "Given that the current state of the art in this area generally does not use deep models, this may be a major opportunity for improvement.", 
        "231": "To this end, we encourage the research community to reach out to Cara Jones, an author of this paper, to obtain a copy of Trafficking-10k and other training data.", 
        "232": "Acknowledgements  We would like to thank William Chargin for creating figures and revising this paper.", 
        "233": "We would also like to thank Torsten Wo\u0308rtwein for his assistance in visualizing our data.", 
        "234": "Furthermore, we would like to thank our anonymous reviewers for their valuable feedback.", 
        "235": "Finally, we would like to acknowledge collaborators from Marinus Analytics for the time and effort that they put into annotating advertise-\nments for the dataset, and for allowing us to use their advertisement data."

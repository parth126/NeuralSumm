        "64": "cort\u2212lexical is a version of cort in which no lexical feature is used, i.e.",

        "67": "the setting used by Clark and Manning (2016a).", 
        "68": "However, based on the performance on the development set, we only train the model for 50 iterations in out-ofdomain evaluations.", 
        "69": "The results of the pt genre show that when there is a high overlap between the training and test datasets, the performance of all learning-based classifiers significantly improves.",

        "71": "cort uses both lexical and a relatively large number of non-lexical features while berkeley-surface is a pure lexicalized system.", 
        "72": "However, the difference between the berkeley-surface\u2019s performances when pt is included or excluded from the training data is lower than that of cort.", 
        "73": "berkeley uses feature-value pruning so lexical features that occur fewer than 20 times are pruned from the training data.", 
        "74": "Maybe, this is the reason that berkeley\u2019s performance difference is less than other lexicalized systems in highly overlapping datasets.",

        "76": "wb, the performance gain of including the genre in the training data is significantly lower for all lexicalized systems.",

        "78": "deep-coref, which uses a complex deep neural network and mainly lexical features, has the highest gain from the redundancy in the training and test datasets.", 
        "79": "As we use more complex neural networks, there is more capacity for brute-force memorization of the training dataset.", 
        "80": "It is also worth noting that the performance gains and drops in out-of-domain evaluations are\nnot entirely because of lexical features, as the performance of cort\u2212lexical also drops significantly in pt out-of-domain evaluation.", 
        "81": "The classifier may also memorize other properties of the seen mentions in the training data.", 
        "82": "However, in comparison to features like gender and number agreement or syntactic roles, lexical features have the highest potential for overfitting.",

        "89": "The results of Table 5 show that most of the incorrect links are also made between the mentions that are both seen in the training data.", 
        "90": "The high ratios indicate that (1) there is a high\noverlap between the mention pairs of the training and development sets, and (2) even though that deep-coref uses generalized word embeddings instead of exact surface forms, it is strongly biased towards the seen mentions.", 
        "91": "We analyze the links that are created by Stanford\u2019s rule-based system and compute the ratio of the links that exist in the training set.", 
        "92": "All corresponding ratios are lower than those of deep-coref in Table 5.", 
        "93": "However, the ratios are surprisingly high for a system that does not use the training data.", 
        "94": "This analysis emphasizes the overlap in the CoNLL datasets.", 
        "95": "Because of this high overlap, it is not easy to assess the generalizability of a coreference resolver to unseen mentions on the CoNLL dataset given its official split.", 
        "96": "We also compute the ratios of Table 5 for the missing links that are associated with the recall er-\nrors of deep-coref.", 
        "97": "We compute the recall errors by cort error analysis tool (Martschat and Strube, 2014).", 
        "98": "Table 6 shows the corresponding ratios for recall errors.", 
        "99": "The lower ratios of Table 6 in comparison to those of Table 4 emphasize the bias of deep-coref towards the seen mentions.", 
        "100": "For example, the deep-coref links include 31 cases in which both mentions are either proper names or common nouns and the head of one of the mentions is \u201ccountry\u201d.", 
        "101": "For all these links, \u201ccountry\u201d is linked to a mention that is seen in the training data.", 
        "102": "Therefore, this raises the question how the classifier would perform on a text about countries not mentioned in the training data.", 
        "103": "Memorizing the pairs in which one of them is a common noun could help the classifier to capture world knowledge to some extent.", 
        "104": "From the seen pairs like (Haiti, his country), and (Guangzhou, the city) the classifier could learn that \u201cHaiti\u201d is a country and \u201cGuangzhou\u201d is a city.", 
        "105": "However, it is questionable how useful word knowledge is if it is mainly based on the training data.", 
        "106": "The coreference relation of two nominal noun phrases with no head match can be very hard to resolve.", 
        "107": "The resolution of such pairs has been referred to as capturing semantic similarity (Clark and Manning, 2016b).", 
        "108": "deep-coref links 49 such pairs on the development set.", 
        "109": "Among all these links, only 5 pairs are unseen on the training set and all of them are incorrect links.",

        "111": "(2015) for tasks like hypernymy and entailment.",

        "113": "The classifiers benefit from this lexical memorization when there are common words between the training and test sets.", 
        "114": "5 Discussion  We show the extensive use of lexical features biases coreference resolvers towards seen mentions.", 
        "115": "This bias holds us back from developing more robust and generalizable coreference resolvers.", 
        "116": "After all, while coreference resolution is an important step for text understanding, it is not an endtask.", 
        "117": "Coreference resolvers are going to be used in tasks and domains for which coreference annotated corpora may not be available.", 
        "118": "Therefore, generalizability should be brought into attention in developing coreference resolvers.", 
        "119": "Moreover, we show that there is a significant overlap between the training and validation sets in the CoNLL dataset.", 
        "120": "The LEA metric (Moosavi and Strube, 2016) is introduced as an attempt to make coreference evaluations more reliable.", 
        "121": "However, in order to ensure valid developments on coreference resolution, it is not enough to have reliable evaluation metrics.", 
        "122": "The validation set on which the evaluations are performed also needs to be reliable.", 
        "123": "A dataset is reliable for evaluations if a considerable improvement on this dataset indicates a better solution for the coreference problem instead of a better exploitation of the dataset itself.", 
        "124": "This paper is not intended to argue against the use of lexical features.", 
        "125": "Especially, when word embeddings are used as lexical features.", 
        "126": "The incorporation of word embeddings is an efficient way for capturing semantic relatedness.", 
        "127": "Maybe we should use them more for describing the context and less for describing the mentions themselves.", 
        "128": "Pruning rare lexical features plus incorporating more generalizable features could also help to prevent overfitting.", 
        "129": "To ensure more meaningful improvements, we ask to incorporate out-of-domain evaluations in the current coreference evaluation scheme.", 
        "130": "Outof-domain evaluations could be performed by using either the existing genres of the CoNLL dataset or by using other existing coreference annotated datasets like WikiCoref, MUC or ACE.",

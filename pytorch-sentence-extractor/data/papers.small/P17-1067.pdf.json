        "7": "It is no exaggeration that humans are emotional beings: Emotions are an integral part of human life, and affect our decision making as well as our mental and physical health.", 
        "8": "As such, developing emotion detection models is important; they have a wide array of applications, ranging from building nuanced virtual assistants that cater for the emotions of their users to detecting the emotions of social media users in order to understand their mental and/or physical health.", 
        "9": "1https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/ definition/emotion.", 
        "10": "However, emotion detection has remained a challenging task, partly due to the limited availability of labeled data and partly due the controversial nature of what emotions themselves are (Aaron C. Weidman and Tracy, 2017).", 
        "11": "Recent advances in machine learning for natural language processing (NLP) suggest that, given enough labeled data, there should be an opportunity to build better emotion detection models.", 
        "12": "Manual labeling of data, however, is costly and so it is desirable to develop labeled emotion data without annotators.", 
        "13": "While the proliferation of social media has made it possible for us to acquire large datasets with implicit labels in the form of hashtags (Mohammad and Kiritchenko, 2015), such labels are noisy and reliable.",

        "15": "More specifically, we harness cues in Twitter data in the form of emotion hashtags as a way to build a labeled emotion dataset that we then exploit using distant supervision (Mintz et al., 2009) (the use of hashtags as a surrogate for annotator-generated emotion labels) to build emotion models grounded in psychology.", 
        "16": "We construct such a dataset and exploit it using powerful deep learning methods to build accurate, high coverage models for emotion prediction.", 
        "17": "Overall, we make the following contributions: 1) Grounded in psychological theory of emotions, we build a large-scale, high quality dataset of tweets labeled with emotions.", 
        "18": "Key to this are methods to ensure data quality, 2) we validate the data collection method using human annotations, 3) we develop powerful deep learning models using a gated recurrent network to exploit the data, yielding new state-of-the-art on 24 fine-grained types of emotions, and 4) we extend the task beyond these emotion types to model Plutick\u2019s 8 primary emotion dimensions.", 
        "19": "718\nOur emotion modeling relies on distant supervision (Read, 2005; Mintz et al., 2009), the approach of using cues in data (e.g., hashtags or emoticons) as a proxy for \u201cground truth\u201d labels as we explained above.", 
        "20": "Distant supervision has been investigated by a number of researchers for emotion detection (Tanaka et al., 2005; Mohammad, 2012; Purver and Battersby, 2012; Wang et al., 2012; Pak and Paroubek, 2010; Yang et al., 2007) and for other semantic tasks such as sentiment analysis (Read, 2005; Go et al., 2009) and sarcasm detection (Gonza\u0301lez-Iba\u0301nez et al., 2011).", 
        "21": "In these works, authors successfully use emoticons and/or hashtags as marks to label data after performing varying degrees of data quality assurance.", 
        "22": "We take a similar approach, using a larger collection of tweets, richer emotion definitions, and stronger filtering for tweet quality.", 
        "23": "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: We first overview related literature in Section 2, describe our data collection in Section 3.1, and the annotation study we performed to validate our distant supervision method in Section 4.", 
        "24": "We then describe our methods in Section 5, provide results in Section 6, and conclude in Section 8.", 
        "25": "2 Related Work    2.1 Computational Treatment of Emotion  The SemEval-2007 Affective Text task (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007) [SEM07] focused on classification of emotion and valence (i.e., positive and negative texts) in news headlines.", 
        "26": "A total of 1,250 headlines were manually labeled with the 6 basic emotions of Ekman (Ekman, 1972) and made available to participants.", 
        "27": "Similarly, (Aman and Szpakowicz, 2007) describe an emotion annotation task of identifying emotion category, emotion intensity and the words/phrases that indicate emotion in blog post data of 4,090 sentences and a system exploiting the data.", 
        "28": "Our work differs from both that of SEM07 (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007) and (Aman and Szpakowicz, 2007) in that we focus on a different genre (i.e., Twitter) and investigate distant supervision as a way to acquire a significantly larger labeled dataset.", 
        "29": "Our work is similar to (Mohammad, 2012; Mohammad and Kiritchenko, 2015), (Wang et al., 2012), and (Volkova and Bachrach, 2016) who use distant supervision to acquire Twitter data with emotion hashtags and report analyses and experiments to validate the utility of this approach.", 
        "30": "For\nexample, (Mohammad, 2012) shows that by using a simple domain adaptation method to train a classifier on their data they are able to improve both precision and recall on the SemEval-2007 (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007) dataset.", 
        "31": "As the author points out, this is another premise that the selflabeled hashtags acquired from Twitter are consistent, to some degree, with the emotion labels given by the trained human judges who labeled the SemEval-2007 data.", 
        "32": "As pointed out earlier, (Wang et al., 2012) randomly sample a set of 400 tweets from their data and human-label as relevant/irrelevant, as a way to verify the distant supervision approach with the quality assurance heuristics they employ.", 
        "33": "The authors found that the precision on a test set is 93.16%, thus confirming the utility of the heuristics.", 
        "34": "(Wang et al., 2012) provide a number of important observations, as conclusions based on their work.", 
        "35": "These include that since they are provided by the tweets\u2019 writers, the emotion hashtags are more natural and reliable than the emotion labels traditionally assigned by annotators to data by a few annotators.", 
        "36": "This is the case since in the lab-condition method annotators need to infer the writers emotions from text, which may not be accurate.", 
        "37": "Additionally, (Volkova and Bachrach, 2016) follow the same distant supervision approach and find correlations of users\u2019 emotional tone and the perceived demographics of these users\u2019 social networks exploiting the emotion hashtag-labeled data.", 
        "38": "Our dataset is more than an order of magnitude larger than (Mohammad, 2012) and (Volkova and Bachrach, 2016) and the range of emotions we target is much more fine grained than (Mohammad, 2012; Wang et al., 2012; Volkova and Bachrach, 2016) since we model 24 emotion types, rather than focus on \u2264 7 basic emotions.", 
        "39": "(Yan et al., 2016; Yan and Turtle, 2016a,b) develop a dataset of 15,553 tweets labeled with 28 emotion types and so target a fine-grained range as we do.", 
        "40": "The authors instruct human annotators under lab conditions to assign any emotion they feel is expressed in the data, allowing them to assign more than one emotion to a given tweet.", 
        "41": "A set of 28 chosen emotions was then decided upon and further annotations were performed using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT).", 
        "42": "The authors cite an agreement of 0.50 Krippendorff\u2019s alpha (\u03b1) between the lab/expert annotators, and an (\u03b1) of 0.28 between experts and AMT workers.", 
        "43": "EmoTweet-\n28 is a useful resource.", 
        "44": "However, the agreement between annotators is not high and the set of assigned labels do not adhere to a specific theory of emotion.", 
        "45": "We use a much larger dataset and report an accuracy of the hashtag approach at 90% based on human judgement as reported in Section 4.", 
        "46": "2.2 Mood  A number of studies have also been performed to analyze and/or model mood in social media data.", 
        "47": "(De Choudhury et al., 2012) identify more than 200 moods frequent on Twitter as extracted from psychological literature and filtered by AMT workers.", 
        "48": "They then collect tweets which have one of the moods in their mood lexicon in the form of a hashtag.", 
        "49": "To verify the quality of the mood data, the authors run AMT studies where they ask workers whether a tweet displayed the respective mood hashtag or not and find that in 83% of the cases hashtagged moods at the end of posts did capture users\u2019 moods, whereas for posts with mood hashtags anywhere in the tweet, only 58% of the cases capture the mood of users.", 
        "50": "Although they did not build models for mood detection, the annotation studies (De Choudhury et al., 2012) perform further support our specific use of hashtags to label emotions.", 
        "51": "(Mishne and De Rijke, 2006) collect user-labeled mood from blog post text on LiveJournal and exploit them for predicting the intensity of moods over a time span rather than at the post level.", 
        "52": "Similarly, (Nguyen, 2010) builds models to infer patterns of moods in a large collection of LiveJournal posts.", 
        "53": "Some of the moods in these LiveJournal studies (e.g., hungry, cold), as (De Choudhury et al., 2012) explain, would not fit any psychological theory.", 
        "54": "Our work is different in that it is situated in psychological theory of emotion.", 
        "55": "2.3 Deep Learning for NLP  In spite of the effectiveness of feature engineering for NLP, it is a labor intensive task that also needs domain expertise.", 
        "56": "More importantly, feature engineering falls short of extracting and organizing all the discriminative information from data (LeCun et al., 2015; Goodfellow et al., 2016).", 
        "57": "Neural networks (Goodfellow et al., 2016) have emerged as a successful class of methods that has the power of automatically discovering the representations needed for detection or classification and has been successfully applied to multiple NLP tasks.", 
        "58": "A line of studies in the literature (e.g., (Labutov and Lip-\nson, 2013; Maas et al., 2011; Tang et al., 2014b,a) aim to learn sentiment-specific word embeddings (Bengio et al., 2003; Mikolov et al., 2013) from neighboring text.", 
        "59": "Another thread of research focuses on learning semantic composition (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010), including extensions to phrases and sentences with recursive neural networks (a class of syntax-tree models) (Socher et al., 2013; Irsoy and Cardie, 2014; Li et al., 2015) and to documents with distributed representations of sentences and paragraphs (Le and Mikolov, 2014; Tang et al., 2015) for modeling sentiment.", 
        "60": "Long-short term memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Neural Nets (GRNNs) (Cho et al., 2014; Chung et al., 2015), variations of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), a type of networks suitable for handling time-series data like speech (Graves et al., 2013) or handwriting recognition (Graves, 2012; Graves and Schmidhuber, 2009), have also been used successfully for sentiment analysis (Ren et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2015; Tai et al., 2015; Tang et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016).", 
        "61": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have also been quite successful in NLP, and have been applied to a range of sentence classification tasks, including sentiment analysis (Blunsom et al., 2014; Kim, 2014; Zhang et al., 2015).", 
        "62": "Other architectures have also been recently proposed (e.g., (Bradbury et al., 2016)).", 
        "63": "A review of neural network methods for NLP can be found in (Goldberg, 2016).", 
        "64": "3 Data    3.1 Collection of a Large-Scale Dataset  To be able to use deep learning for modeling emotion, we needed a large dataset of labeled tweets.", 
        "65": "Since there is no such human-labeled dataset publicly available, we follow (Mohammad, 2012; Mintz et al., 2009; Purver and Battersby, 2012; Gonza\u0301lez-Iba\u0301nez et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012) in adopting distant supervision: We collect tweets with emotion-carrying hashtags as a surrogate for emotion labels.", 
        "66": "To be able to collect enough tweets to serve our need, we developed a list of hashtags representing each of the 24 emotions proposed by Robert Plutchick (Plutchik, 1980, 1985, 1994).", 
        "67": "Plutchik (Plutchik, 2001) organizes emotions in a three-dimensional circumplex model analogous to the colors on a color wheel.",

        "69": "The eight sectors are meant to capture that there are eight primary emotion dimensions arranged as four pairs of opposites.", 
        "70": "Emotions in the blank spaces are the primary emotion dyads (i.e., emotions that are mixtures of two of the primary emotions).", 
        "71": "For this work, we exclude the dyads in the exploded model from our treatment.", 
        "72": "For simplicity, we refer to the circles as plutchik-1: with the emotions {admiration, amazement, ecstasy, grief, loathing, rage, terror, vigilance}, plutchik-2: with the emotions {joy, trust, fear, surprise, sadness, disgust, anger, anticipation}, and plutchik-3: with the emotions {acceptance, annoyance, apprehension, boredom, distraction, interest, pensiveness, serenity}.", 
        "73": "The wheel is shown in Figure 1.", 
        "74": "For each emotion type, we prepared a seed set of hashtags representing the emotion.", 
        "75": "We used Google synonyms and other online dictionaries and thesauri (e.g., www.thesaurus.", 
        "76": "com) to expand the initial seed set of each emotion.", 
        "77": "We acquire a total of 665 emotion hashtags across the 24 emotion types.", 
        "78": "For example, for the joy emotion, a subset of the seeds in our expanded set is {\u201chappy\u201d, \u201chappiness\u201d, \u201cjoy\u201d, \u201cjoyful\u201d, \u201cjoyfully\u201d, \u201cdelighted\u201d, \u201cfeelingsunny\u201d, \u201cblithe\u201d, \u201cbeatific\u201d, \u201cexhilarated\u201d, \u201cblissful\u201d, \u201cwalkingonair\u201d, \u201cjubilant\u201d}.", 
        "79": "We then used the expanded set to extract tweets with hashtags from the set from a number of massive-scale in-house Twitter datasets.", 
        "80": "We also used Twitter API to crawl Twitter with hashtags from the expanded set.", 
        "81": "Using this method, we were able to acquire a dataset of about 1/4 billion tweets covering an extended time span from July 2009 till January 2017.", 
        "82": "3.2 Preprocessing and Quality Assurance  Twitter data are very noisy, not only because of use of non-standard typography (which is less of a problem here) but due to the many duplicate tweets and the fact that tweets often have multiple emotion hashtags.", 
        "83": "Since these reduce our ability to build accurate models, we need to clean the data and remove duplicates.", 
        "84": "Starting with > 1/4 billion tweets, we employ a rigorous and strict pipeline.", 
        "85": "This results in a vastly smaller set of about 1.6 million dependable labeled tweets.", 
        "86": "Since our goal is to create non-overlapping categories at the level of a tweet, we first removed all tweets with hashtags belonging to more than one emotion of the 24 emotion categories.", 
        "87": "Since it was observed (e.g., (Mohammad, 2012; Wang et al., 2012)) and also confirmed by our annotation study as described in Section 4, that hashtags in tweets with URLs are less likely to correlate with a true emotion label, we remove all tweets with URLs from our data.", 
        "88": "We filter out duplicates using a two-step procedure: 1) we remove all retweets (based on existence of the token \u201cRT\u201d regardless of case) and 2) we use the Python library pandas http://pandas.",

        "90": "We then performed a manual inspection of a random sample of 1,000 tweets from the data and found no evidence of any remaining tweet duplicates.", 
        "91": "Next, even though the emotion hashtags themselves are exclusively in English, we observe the data do have tweets in languages other than English.", 
        "92": "This is due to code-switching, but also to the fact that our data dates back to 2009 and Twitter did not allow use of hashtags for several non-English languages until 2012.", 
        "93": "To filter out non-English, we use the langid (Lui and Baldwin, 2012) (https://github.com/ saffsd/langid.py) library to assign language tags to the tweets.", 
        "94": "Since the common wisdom in the literature (e.g., (Mohammad, 2012; Wang et al., 2012)) is to restrict data to hashtags occurring in final position of a tweet, we investigate correlations between a tweet\u2019s relevance and emotion hashtag location in Section 4 and test models exclusively on data with hashtags occurring in final position.", 
        "95": "We also only use tweets con-\ntaining at least 5 words.", 
        "96": "Table 2 shows statistics of the data after applying our cleaning, filtering, language identification, and deduplication pipeline.", 
        "97": "Since our focus is on English, we only show statistics for tweets tagged with an \u201cen\u201d (for \u201cEnglish\u201d) label by langid.", 
        "98": "Table 2 provides three types of relevant statistics: 1) counts of all tweets, 2) counts of tweets with at least 5 words and the emotion hashtags occurring in the last quarter of the tweet text (based on character count), and 3) counts of tweets with at least 5 words and the emotion hashtags occurring as the final word in the tweet text.", 
        "99": "As the last column in Table 2 shows, employing our most strict criterion where an emotion hashtag must occur finally in a tweet of a minimal length 5 words, we acquire a total of 1,608,233 tweets: 205,125 tweets for plutchik-1, 790,059 for plutchik-2, and 613,049 for plutchik-3.",

        "108": "Our analysis of this manually labeled dataset also supports the findings of (Wang et al., 2012): When we limit position of the emotion hashtag to the end of a tweet, we acquire 90.57% relevant data.", 
        "109": "We also find that if we relax the constraint on the hashtag position such that we allow the hashtag to occur in the last quarter of a tweet (based on a total tweet character count), we acquire 85.43% relevant tweets.", 
        "110": "We also find that only 23.20% (n = 795 out of 3, 427) of the emotion carrying tweets have the emotion hashtags occurring in final position, whereas 31.75% (n = 1, 088 out of 3, 427) of the tweets have the emotion hashtags in the last quarter of the tweet string.",

        "113": "Overall, we agree with (Mohammad, 2012; Wang et al., 2012) that the accuracy acquired by enforcing a strict pipeline and limiting to emotion hashtags to final position is a reasonable measure for warranting good-quality data for training supervised systems, an assumption we have also validated with our empirical findings here.", 
        "114": "One advantage of using distant supervision under these conditions for labeling emotion data, as (Wang et al., 2012) also notes, is that the label is assigned by the writer of the tweet himself/herself rather than an annotator who could wrongly decide what category a tweet is.", 
        "115": "After all, emotion is a fuzzy concept and > 90% agreement as we\nreport here is higher than the human agreement usually acquired on many NLP tasks.", 
        "116": "Another advantage of this method is obviously that it enables us to acquire a sufficiently large training set to use deep learning.",

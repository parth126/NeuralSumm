        "166": "In our experiments with the full PP attachment dataset, we learned embeddings for 18k synset types with OntoLSTM-PP and 11k word types with LSTM-PP.", 
        "167": "Since the biggest contribution to the parameter space comes from the embedding layer, the complexities of both the models are comparable.", 
        "168": "5 Related Work  This work is related to various lines of research within the NLP community: dealing with synonymy and homonymy in word representations both in the context of distributed embeddings and more traditional vector spaces; hybrid models of distributional and knowledge based semantics; and selectional preferences and their relation with syntactic and semantic relations.", 
        "169": "The need for going beyond a single vector per word-type has been well established for a while, and many efforts were focused on building multi-prototype vector space models of meaning (Reisinger and Mooney, 2010; Huang et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2014; Jauhar et al., 2015; Neelakantan et al., 2015; Arora et al., 2016, etc.).", 
        "170": "However, the target of all these approaches is obtaining multisense word vector spaces, either by incorporating sense tagged information or other kinds of external context.", 
        "171": "The number of vectors learned is still fixed, based on the preset number of senses.", 
        "172": "In contrast, our focus is on learning a context dependent distribution over those concept representations.", 
        "173": "Other work not necessarily related to multisense vectors, but still related to our work includes Belanger and Kakade (2015)\u2019s work which proposed a Gaussian linear dynamical system for estimating token-level word embeddings, and Vilnis and McCallum (2015)\u2019s work which proposed mapping each word type to a density instead of a point in a space to account for uncertainty in meaning.", 
        "174": "These approaches do not make use of lexical ontologies and are not amenable for joint training with a downstream NLP task.", 
        "175": "Related to the idea of concept embeddings is Rothe and Schu\u0308tze (2015) who estimated WordNet synset representations, given pre-trained typelevel word embeddings.", 
        "176": "In contrast, our work focuses on estimating token-level word embeddings as context sensitive distributions of concept em-\nbeddings.", 
        "177": "There is a large body of work that tried to improve word embeddings using external resources.", 
        "178": "Yu and Dredze (2014) extended the CBOW model (Mikolov et al., 2013) by adding an extra term in the training objective for generating words conditioned on similar words according to a lexicon.", 
        "179": "Jauhar et al.", 
        "180": "(2015) extended the skipgram model (Mikolov et al., 2013) by representing word senses as latent variables in the generation process, and used a structured prior based on the ontology.", 
        "181": "Faruqui et al.", 
        "182": "(2015) used belief propagation to update pre-trained word embeddings on a graph that encodes lexical relationships in the ontology.", 
        "183": "Similarly, Johansson and Pina (2015) improved word embeddings by representing each sense of the word in a way that reflects the topology of the semantic network they belong to, and then representing the words as convex combinations of their senses.", 
        "184": "In contrast to previous work that was aimed at improving type level word representations, we propose an approach for obtaining context-sensitive embeddings at the token level, while jointly optimizing the model parameters for the NLP task of interest.", 
        "185": "Resnik (1993) showed the applicability of semantic classes and selectional preferences to resolving syntactic ambiguity.", 
        "186": "Zapirain et al.", 
        "187": "(2013) applied models of selectional preferences auto-\nmatically learned from WordNet and distributional information, to the problem of semantic role labeling.", 
        "188": "Resnik (1993); Brill and Resnik (1994); Agirre (2008) and others have used WordNet information towards improving prepositional phrase attachment predictions.", 
        "189": "6 Conclusion  In this paper, we proposed a grounding of lexical items which acknowledges the semantic ambiguity of word types using WordNet and a method to learn a context-sensitive distribution over their representations.", 
        "190": "We also showed how to integrate the proposed representation with recurrent neural networks for disambiguating prepositional phrase attachments, showing that the proposed WordNetgrounded context-sensitive token embeddings outperforms standard type-level embeddings for predicting PP attachments.", 
        "191": "We provided a detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis of the proposed model.", 
        "192": "Implementation and code availability.", 
        "193": "The models are implemented using Keras (Chollet, 2015), and the functionality is available at https://github.com/pdasigi/ onto-lstm in the form of Keras layers to make it easier to use the proposed embedding model in other NLP problems.", 
        "194": "Future work.", 
        "195": "This approach may be extended to other NLP tasks that can benefit from using encoders that can access WordNet information.", 
        "196": "WordNet also has some drawbacks, and may not always have sufficient coverage given the task at hand.", 
        "197": "As we have shown in \u00a74.2, our model can deal with missing WordNet information by augmenting it with distributional information.", 
        "198": "Moreover, the methods described in this paper can be extended to other kinds of structured knowledge sources like Freebase which may be more suitable for tasks like question answering.",

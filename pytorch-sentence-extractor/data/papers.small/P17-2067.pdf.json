        "3": "The worst real-world impact is that fake news seems to create real-life fears: last year, a man carried an AR-15 rifle and walked in a Washington DC Pizzeria, because he recently read online that \u201cthis pizzeria was harbor-\ning young children as sex slaves as part of a childabuse ring led by Hillary Clinton\u201d1.",

        "9": "Even though crowdsourcing is an important approach to create labeled training data, there is a mismatch between training and testing.", 
        "10": "When testing on real-world review datasets, the results could be suboptimal since the positive training data was created in a completely different, simulated platform.", 
        "11": "The problem of fake news detection is more challenging than detecting deceptive reviews, since the political language on TV interviews, posts on Facebook and Twitters are mostly short statements.",

        "23": "They are very useful datasets to study deception detection, but the positive training data are collected from a simulated environment.", 
        "24": "More importantly, these datasets are not suitable for fake statements detection, since the fake news on TVs and social media are much shorter than customer reviews.",

        "73": "We considered 0.5 and 0.8 as dropout probabilities.", 
        "74": "The hybrid model requires 5 training epochs.", 
        "75": "We used grid search to tune the hyperparameters for LR and SVM models.", 
        "76": "We chose accuracy as the evaluation metric, since we found that the accuracy results from various models were equivalent to f-measures on this balanced dataset.", 
        "77": "4.2 Results  We outline our empirical results in Table 2.", 
        "78": "First, we compare various models using text features only.", 
        "79": "We see that the majority baseline on this dataset gives about 0.204 and 0.208 accuracy on the validation and test sets respectively.", 
        "80": "Standard text classifier such as SVMs and LR models obtained significant improvements.", 
        "81": "Due to overfitting, the Bi-LSTMs did not perform well.",

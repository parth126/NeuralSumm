        "93": "On the other hand, we estimated a reliable rating from the crowd ratings using MACE (Hovy et al., 2013) and compared it to the experts.",

        "95": "For the mean ratings, most \u03b1-values are above .40.",

        "97": "(2017b), where a range of .27 to .51 is reported, meaning that lay annotators achieve similar agreement to experts.", 
        "98": "Considering the minimum of mean and MACE, we observe the highest agreement for overall quality (.43)\u2014analog to Wachsmuth et al.", 
        "99": "(2017b).", 
        "100": "Also, global sufficiency has the lowest agreement in both cases.", 
        "101": "In contrast, the experts hardly said \u201ccannot judge\u201d at all, whereas the crowd chose it for about 4% of all ratings (most often for global sufficiency), possibly due to a lack of training.", 
        "102": "Still, we conclude that the crowd generally handles the theory-based quality assessment almost as well as the experts.", 
        "103": "However, the complexity of the assessment is underlined by the generally limited agreement, suggesting that either simplification or stricter guidelines are needed.", 
        "104": "Regarding simplification, the most common practical reasons of Habernal and Gurevych (2016a) imply what to focus on.", 
        "105": "4.3 Reliability of the Crowd Annotations  In the second comparison, we checked how many crowd annotators are needed to compete with the experts.", 
        "106": "For this purpose, we split the crowd ratings into two independent groups of 5 and treated the mean and MACE of each group as a single rating.", 
        "107": "We then computed the agreement of both groups and each group individually against the experts.", 
        "108": "The \u03b1-values for both groups are listed in Table 5(b).", 
        "109": "On average, they are a bit lower than those of all 10 crowd annotators in Table 5(a).", 
        "110": "Hence, five crowd ratings per argument seem not enough\nfor sufficient reliability.", 
        "111": "Tables 5(c) and 5(d) reveal the reason behind, namely, the results of crowd group 1 and group 2 differ clearly.", 
        "112": "At the same time, the values in Table 5(c) are close to those in Table 5(a), so 10 ratings might suffice.", 
        "113": "Moreover, we see that the most stable \u03b1-values in Table 5 are given for overall quality, indicating that the theory indeed helps assessing quality reliably.", 
        "114": "5 Conclusion  This paper demonstrates that the theory and practice of assessing argumentation quality can learn from each other.", 
        "115": "Most reasons for quality differences phrased in practice seem well-represented in the normative view of theory and correlate with absolute quality ratings.", 
        "116": "In our study, lay annotators had similar agreement on the ratings as experts.", 
        "117": "Considering that some common reasons are quite vague, the diverse and comprehensive theoretical view of argumentation quality may guide a more insightful assessment.", 
        "118": "On the other hand, some quality dimensions remain hard to assess and/or to separate in practice, resulting in limited agreement.", 
        "119": "Simplifying theory along the most important reasons will thus improve its practical applicability.",

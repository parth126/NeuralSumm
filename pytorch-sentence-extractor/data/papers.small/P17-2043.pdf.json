        "2": "Since compressive summarization methods can use a sub-sentence as an atomic unit, they can pack more information into summaries than extractive methods, which employ sentences as atomic units.", 
        "3": "Thus, compressive summarization is essential when we want to produce summaries under tight length constraints.", 
        "4": "There are two approaches to compress entire document(s) to be grammatical; one is trimming the phrase structure trees (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011) and the other is trimming the dependency trees obtained from the document(s) (Martins and Smith, 2009; Almeida and Martins, 2013; Qian and Liu, 2013; Kikuchi et al., 2014; Yao et al.,\n2015).",

        "7": "ROUGE evaluates a system summary by exploiting a set of human-made reference summaries to give a score in the range [0,1].", 
        "8": "When n-gram occurrences of the system summary agree with those in a set of reference summaries, the value is 1.", 
        "9": "However, system summaries cannot achieve ROUGE=1 since summarization systems cannot reproduce reference summaries in most cases.", 
        "10": "In other words, the maximum ROUGE score that can be achieved by compressive summarization is unclear.", 
        "11": "As a result, researchers cannot know how much room for further improvement is left.",

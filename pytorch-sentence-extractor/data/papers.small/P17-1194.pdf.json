        "2": "Specialised approaches to sequence labeling often include extensive feature engineering, such as integrated gazetteers, capitalisation features, morphological information and POS tags.", 
        "3": "However, recent work has shown that neural network architectures are able to achieve comparable or improved performance, while automatically discovering useful features for a specific task and only requiring a sequence of tokens as input (Collobert et al., 2011; Irsoy and Cardie, 2014; Lample et al., 2016).",

        "10": "The task of language modeling offers an easily accessible objective \u2013 learning to predict the next word in the sequence requires only plain text as input, without relying on any particular annotation.", 
        "11": "Neural language modeling architectures also have many similarities to common sequence labeling frameworks: words are first mapped to distributed embeddings, followed by a recurrent neural network (RNN) module for composing word sequences into an informative context representation (Mikolov et al., 2010; Graves et al., 2013; Chelba et al., 2013).", 
        "12": "Compared to any sequence labeling dataset, the task of language modeling has a considerably larger and more varied set of possible options to predict, making better use of each available word and encouraging the model to learn more general language features for accurate composition.",

        "56": "We also use the opportunity to map the representation to a smaller size \u2013 since language modeling is not the\nmain goal, we restrict the number of parameters available for this component, forcing the model to generalise more using fewer resources.",

        "150": "(2015)), in order to investigate performance on morphologically complex and Romance languages.", 
        "151": "These datasets are somewhat more balanced in terms of label distributions, compared to error detection and NER, as no single label covers over 50% of the tokens.", 
        "152": "POS-tagging also offers a large variance of unique labels, with 48 labels in PTB and 42 in GENIA, and this can provide useful information to the models during training.", 
        "153": "The baseline performance on these datasets is also close to the upper bound, therefore we expect the language modeling objective to not provide much additional benefit.", 
        "154": "The results of different sequence labeling architectures on POS-tagging can be seen in Table 3 and accuracy on the development set is shown in Figure 4.", 
        "155": "While the performance improvements are small, they are consistent across all domains, languages and datasets.", 
        "156": "Application of dropout again provides a more robust model, and the language modeling cost improves the performance further.", 
        "157": "Even though the labels already offer a varied training objective, learning to predict the surrounding words at the same time has provided the model with additional general-purpose features.", 
        "158": "8 Related Work  Our work builds on previous research exploring multi-task learning in the context of different sequence labeling tasks.", 
        "159": "The idea of multi-task learning was described by Caruana (1998) and has since been extended to many language processing tasks using neural networks.", 
        "160": "For example, Collobert and Weston (2008) proposed a multitask framework using weight-sharing between networks that are optimised for different supervised tasks.", 
        "161": "Cheng et al.", 
        "162": "(2015) described a system for detecting out-of-vocabulary names by also predicting the next word in the sequence.", 
        "163": "While they use a regular recurrent architecture, we propose a language modeling objective that can be integrated with a bidirectional network, making it applicable to existing state-of-the-art sequence labeling frameworks.", 
        "164": "Plank et al.", 
        "165": "(2016) described a related architecture for POS-tagging, predicting the frequency of each word together with the part-of-speech, and showed that this can improve tagging accuracy on low-frequency words.", 
        "166": "While predicting word frequency can be useful for POS-tagging, language modeling provides a more general training signal, allowing us to apply the model to many different\nsequence labeling tasks.", 
        "167": "Recently, Augenstein and S\u00f8gaard (2017) explored multi-task learning for classifying keyphrase boundaries, by incorporating tasks such as semantic super-sense tagging and identification of multi-word expressions.", 
        "168": "Bingel and S\u00f8gaard (2017) also performed a systematic comparison of task relationships by combining different datasets through multi-task learning.", 
        "169": "Both of these approaches involve switching to auxiliary datasets, whereas our proposed language modeling objective requires no additional data.", 
        "170": "9 Conclusion  We proposed a novel sequence labeling framework with a secondary objective \u2013 learning to predict surrounding words for each word in the dataset.", 
        "171": "One half of a bidirectional LSTM is trained as a forward-moving language model, whereas the other half is trained as a backward-moving language model.", 
        "172": "At the same time, both of these are also combined, in order to predict the most probable label for each word.", 
        "173": "This modification can be applied to several common sequence labeling architectures and requires no additional annotated or unannotated data.", 
        "174": "The objective of learning to predict surrounding words provides an additional source of information during training.", 
        "175": "The model is incentivised to discover useful features in order to learn the language distribution and composition patterns in the training data.", 
        "176": "While language modeling is not the main goal of the system, this additional training objective leads to more accurate sequence labeling models on several different tasks.", 
        "177": "The architecture was evaluated on a range of datasets, covering the tasks of error detection in\nlearner texts, named entity recognition, chunking and POS-tagging.", 
        "178": "We found that the additional language modeling objective provided consistent performance improvements on every benchmark.", 
        "179": "The largest benefit from the new architecture was observed on the task of error detection in learner writing.", 
        "180": "The label distribution in the original dataset is very sparse and unbalanced, making it a difficult task for the model to learn.", 
        "181": "The added language modeling objective allowed the system to take better advantage of the available training data, leading to 3.9% absolute improvement over the previous best architecture.", 
        "182": "The language modeling objective also provided consistent improvements on other sequence labeling tasks, such as named entity recognition, chunking and POS-tagging.", 
        "183": "Future work could investigate the extension of this architecture to additional unannotated resources.",

        "2": "For instance, the author uses linguistic cues to mark the embedded proposition as factual in (1) (cue: surprising), as uncertain in (2) and (3) (cues: risk, might), and as counterfactual (cue: did not manage) or uncertain (cue: will not manage) in (4).", 
        "3": "(1) It is not surprising that they work.", 
        "4": "(2) She takes the risk to find out the truth.", 
        "5": "(3) She might find out the truth.", 
        "6": "(4) He did/will not manage to be in time.", 
        "7": "Detecting factuality is hard as the linguistic means used to express it closely interact.", 
        "8": "For example, lexical cues, such as the proposition-embedding predicates in (1) and (4) interact with negation (in (1), (4)) and tense (in (4)).", 
        "9": "Detecting factuality has many potential applications.", 
        "10": "For instance, in knowledge base population, only propositions marked as factual should be admitted into the knowledge base, while hypothetical or negated ones should be left out.", 
        "11": "Similarly, for argumentation analysis and question answering, factuality can play a major role in backing a specific claim or supporting evidence for an answer to a question at hand.", 
        "12": "Recent research efforts have approached the factuality task from two complementing directions: automatic prediction and large scale annotation.", 
        "13": "Previous attempts for automatic factuality prediction either took a rule-based, deep syntactic approach (Lotan et al., 2013; Saur\u0131\u0301 and Pustejovsky, 2012) or a machine learning approach over more shallow features (Lee et al., 2015).", 
        "14": "In terms of annotation, each effort was largely carried out independently of the others, picking up different factuality flavors and different annotation scales.", 
        "15": "In correlation, the proposed algorithms have targeted a single annotated resource which they aim to recover.", 
        "16": "Subsequently, this separation between annotated corpora has prevented a comparison across datasets.", 
        "17": "Further, the models are nonportable, inhibiting advancements in one dataset to carry over to any of the other annotations.", 
        "18": "Our contribution in this work is twofold.", 
        "19": "First, we suggest that the task can benefit from a unified representation.", 
        "20": "We exemplify this by mapping the representation of two recent datasets (FactBank (Saur\u0131\u0301 and Pustejovsky, 2009) and MEANTIME (Minard et al., 2016)) onto the [\u22123,+3] scale, as annotated by (Lee et al., 2015).", 
        "21": "This unification allows us to test the generality of mod-\n352\nels which were previously applicable on a single dataset.", 
        "22": "Second, we design a new model for factuality prediction that extends TruthTeller (Lotan et al., 2013), which employed implicative signatures (MacCartney and Manning, 2009; Karttunen, 2012) over dependency trees using a large predicate lexicon.", 
        "23": "We first extend TruthTeller\u2019s lexicon by about 40% through a semi-automatic process (following Eckle-Kohler (2016)).", 
        "24": "We then apply TruthTeller\u2019s rules over an abstraction of dependency trees (Stanovsky et al., 2016), which represents predicate-argument structures more consistently, thereby allowing TruthTeller rules to apply on a wider range of syntactic constructions.", 
        "25": "Finally, we surpass previous methods by using the output from TruthTeller as deep linguisticallyinformed features in a supervised classifier, thus successfully integrating a rule-based approach in a machine learning framework.", 
        "26": "Overall, we hope that our unified representation will enable training and testing on larger, more diverse datasets, and that the good performance of our new model indicates its usability across different flavors of factuality prediction.", 
        "27": "We make both the unified factuality corpus and the new model publicly available.1  2 Background  Factuality prediction requires the identification of uncertainty, a concept which largely corresponds to the linguistic notion of modality (Hacquard, 2011).", 
        "28": "Modality expresses possibilities and necessities by means of negation, modal verbs (may, might, can), main verbs (agree, refuse), adjectives (dishonest), future tense (will, won\u2019t), and more.", 
        "29": "Looking at the numerous and varied possibilities language offers to express all the different shades of modality, it is clear that factuality does not assume any fixed set of discrete values either.", 
        "30": "Instead, the underlying linguistic system forms a continuous spectrum ranging from factual to counterfactual (Saur\u0131\u0301 and Pustejovsky, 2009).", 
        "31": "While linguistic theory assigns a spectrum of factuality values, recent years have seen many practical efforts to capture the notion of factuality in a consistent annotation (Saur\u0131\u0301 and Pustejovsky, 2009; Nissim et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2015; OGorman et al., 2016; Minard et al., 2016; Ghia et al., 2016).", 
        "32": "Each of these make certain deci-\n1https://github.com/gabrielStanovsky/ unified-factuality\nsions regarding the granularity of factuality that they aim to extract.", 
        "33": "In the course of this work we chose to set our focus on three of these annotations: FactBank (Saur\u0131\u0301 and Pustejovsky, 2009), MEANTIME (Minard et al., 2016) and the UW corpus (Lee et al., 2015).", 
        "34": "We use these specific corpora as they represent recent efforts, display a range of different design choices (e.g., in their notion of factuality and method of annotation), and are made publicly available which ensures the ease of the reproducibility of our experiments.", 
        "35": "Table 1 sums the properties and variations of these corpora.", 
        "36": "For example, we can see that: (1) the UW corpus uses a continuous scale and is annotated by crowdsourcing, while MEANTIME and FactBank were annotated discretely by experts, (2) FactBank annotates factuality from different perspectives, and (3) MEANTIME is significantly smaller compared to the other corpora.", 
        "37": "In parallel with the creation of these annotated resources, several efforts were made to predict factuality in an automatic manner.", 
        "38": "The methods for doing so can be largely divided into rule-based systems which examine deep linguistic features, and machine learning algorithms which generally extract more shallow features.", 
        "39": "The De Facto factuality profiler (Saur\u0131\u0301 and Pustejovsky, 2012) and TruthTeller algorithms (Lotan et al., 2013) take the rule-based approach and assign a discrete annotation of factuality (following the values assigned by FactBank) using a deterministic rule-based topdown approach on dependency trees, changing the factuality assessment when encountering factuality affecting predicates or modality and negation cues (following implicative signatures by Karttunen (2012)).", 
        "40": "In addition to a factuality assessment, TruthTeller assigns three values per predicate in the sentence: (1) implicative signature from a hand-coded lexicon indicating how this predicate changes the factuality of its embedded clause, in positive and negative contexts, (2) clause truth, marking the factuality assessment of the entire clause, and (3) negation and uncertainty, indicating whether this predicate is affected by negation or modality.", 
        "41": "Both of these algorithms rely on a hand-written lexicon of predicates, indicating how they modify the factuality status of their embedded predicates (e.g., refuse negates while assure asserts it).", 
        "42": "In this work we will make use of the more recent TruthTeller which uses a much larger lexicon of 1,700 predicates (verbs, adjectives and\nnouns) compared to De Facto\u2019s lexicon, which contains 646 predicates.", 
        "43": "In a separate attempt which we will call UW system, Lee et al.", 
        "44": "(2015) have used SVM regression techniques to predict a continuous factuality value from lexical and syntactic features (lemma, part of speech, and dependency paths).", 
        "45": "Similarly to the TruthTeller approach, they also predict a single factuality value pertaining to the author\u2019s commitment towards the predicate.", 
        "46": "3 Unified Factuality Representation  We achieve a unified representation by mapping FactBank and MEANTIME onto the UW [\u22123,+3] range in a simple automatic rule-based manner.", 
        "47": "Table 1 describes these rules (see column \u201cOur mapping\u201d), which were hand-written by consulting the annotation guidelines of each of the corpora.", 
        "48": "Specifically, in converting FactBank we take only the author\u2019s perspective annotations as these comply with the annotations of the other corpora, and for MEANTIME we use their proposed abstraction into factual, uncertain and possible (in the future).", 
        "49": "We map from the discrete values (MEANTIME and FactBank) to the continuous scale (UW) since this conversion is lossless: if two events receive different factuality values in the original annotation, they will also differ in the unified representation, and vice versa.", 
        "50": "Furthermore, since FactBank and MEANTIME are both discrete, it is not clear a priori how to map between them.", 
        "51": "Label distribution Given the above conversion, we can plot the label distribution of all three corpora on the same scale (Figure 1).", 
        "52": "This analysis\nreveals that all corpora are significantly skewed towards the factual end of the scale, where the majority of the annotation mass is located.", 
        "53": "In particular, we find that MEANTIME is especially biased, assigning the factual value (+3) to 90% of its event annotations.", 
        "54": "Overall, we suspect that this is an inherent trait of the news domain which tends to be more factual than other text types (e.g., educational texts or opinion pieces).", 
        "55": "4 Model  Following the automatic conversion which achieves a unified representation for our three datasets, we devise a factuality prediction model composed of three main components: (1) augmentation of the TruthTeller lexicon with about 800 adjectival, nominal and verbal predicates, (2) syntactic re-ordering with PropS (Stanovsky et al., 2016), (3) application of TruthTeller on top of PropS trees (Lotan et al., 2013).", 
        "56": "In the following we describe these components.", 
        "57": "Extending TruthTeller\u2019s lexicon We extended the TruthTeller lexicon of single-word predicates by integrating a large resource of modality markers.", 
        "58": "Following the approach of Eckle-Kohler (2016), we first induced the modality status of English adjectives and nouns from the subcategorization frames of their German counterparts listed in a large valency lexicon (using the \u201cIMSLex German Lexicon\u201d (Fitschen, 2004) and Google Translate for obtaining the translations2).", 
        "59": "We focused on four modality classes (the classes whfactual and wh/if-factual indicating factuality, and the two classes future-orientation and non-factual, indicating uncertainty)3 and semi-automatically mapped them to the signatures used in TruthTeller.", 
        "60": "We performed the same kind of mapping for the modality classes of English verbs provided by Eckle-Kohler (2016).", 
        "61": "The result of this process extended TruthTeller\u2019s lexicon by roughly 40% (265 adjectives, 281 nouns, and 133 verbs).", 
        "62": "Integrating PropS with TruthTeller PropS was recently presented as an abstraction over dependency trees.", 
        "63": "Most convenient in our case is its re-ordering of non-verbal predicates (adjectival, conditional, non-lexical, etc.)", 
        "64": "such that each predicate is the direct head of its respective arguments.", 
        "65": "For example, for adjectival predication, compare the different parses in Figure 2.", 
        "66": "PropS positions dishonest as the head of said, which is subsequently the head of paid.", 
        "67": "This chain allows the implicative signature encoded in TruthTeller to capture this complex relation.", 
        "68": "The dependency syn-\n2We used the translation function available as part of Google Sheets.", 
        "69": "https://www.google.com/sheets and removed all translation pairs with English multi-words.", 
        "70": "3In Eckle-Kohler (2016), these are the classes containing the majority of the verb types.", 
        "71": "tax, in contrast, obstructs this relation by positing dishonest as a leaf node under when.", 
        "72": "The overall consistency of PropS annotation allows the topdown approach of TruthTeller to apply to predicates beyond the verbal case.", 
        "73": "Finally, we take as features all four TruthTeller annotations (see Section 2) of the target predicate, its PropS head and its children (padding or truncating to 4 children).", 
        "74": "For a fair comparison with the UW system, we use these features to train an SVM regression (Basak et al., 2007) model to predict the final factuality value.", 
        "75": "5 Evaluation  In this section we describe the experiments we carried out on the three unified datasets (FactBank, MEANTIME, and UW).", 
        "76": "For a fair comparison, we use the same train, development, test split of the datasets for all systems.", 
        "77": "We preprocess the data with the spaCy Python library.4 In all our experiments we compute the metrics used in Lee et al.", 
        "78": "(2015): (1) Mean Absolute Error5 (MAE), which computes the absolute fit of the model and (2) Pearson correlation coefficient between automatic predictions and gold labels, especially informative in biased test sets as it assesses how well the model captures the variability in the gold data.", 
        "79": "5.1 Baselines  We test the performance of our model on the unified factuality corpus against that of several algorithms, representing the state-of-the-art (SoA) in competing approaches.", 
        "80": "Rule-based approach For a SoA rule-based approach we use TruthTeller with extended lexicon as described in Section 4.", 
        "81": "We convert its discrete predictions to the [-3, +3] scale using a handwritten conversion table, similarly to our mapping of FactBank annotations.", 
        "82": "Supervised approach The SoA for supervised learning is represented by the features from the UW system.", 
        "83": "We note that for practical issues, we did not use the same solver6, but instead used support vector regression (SVR) model with a linear kernel (as implemented in the scikit-learn Python\n4https://spacy.io 5Note that in our case this ranges between 0 (perfect per-\nformance) and 6 (worst performance).", 
        "84": "6UW used the IBM CPLEX Optimizer\nlibrary7).", 
        "85": "All hyperparameters were tuned on the development set.", 
        "86": "Semantic representation approach In addition to the rule-based and supervised approaches, we experimented with a semantic abstraction of the sentence.", 
        "87": "For that end, we extracted features inspired by the UW system on the popular AMR formalism (Banarescu et al., 2013) using a SoA parser (Pust et al., 2015).", 
        "88": "Our hope was that this would improve performance by focusing on the more semantically-significant portions of the predicate-argument structure.", 
        "89": "In particular, we extracted the following features from the predicted AMR structures: immediate parents, grandparents and siblings of the target node, lemma and POS tag of the target and preceding token in the sentence, and a Boolean feature based on the AMR polarity role (indicating semantic negation).", 
        "90": "All-factual approach Finally, we compare against an all-factual baseline which assigns +3.0 to all predicates.", 
        "91": "Since the task is by nature heavily biased towards the factual label, it is interesting to compare against such a simple (yet strong) lower bound.", 
        "92": "See the supplemental material for a technical elaboration on the baselines implementation.", 
        "93": "5.2 Results  Several observations can be made following the results on our test sets (Table 2).", 
        "94": "Rule-based baseline is a good starting point The rule-based performance is well correlated with the gold predictions on FactBank and UW, showing its off-the-shelf usability.", 
        "95": "Supervised setting improves performance Adding our features provided a predictive signal for factuality assessment on all test sets.", 
        "96": "More significant improvement is observed in the larger FactBank and UW corpora.", 
        "97": "UW achieves good correlation UW gives a more diverse annotation thanks to its richer feature set (including lemma and dependency path).", 
        "98": "While this hurts MAE in some scenarios, it overall leads to good correlation with the gold data.", 
        "99": "MEANTIME proves especially hard None of the systems were able to surpass the all-factual baseline in terms of MAE on MEANTIME.", 
        "100": "This\n7http://scikit-learn.org/\nis due to its much smaller size and heavy factual bias (assigning +3.0 to 90% of the predicates).", 
        "101": "AMR models achieve comparable performance While AMR provides a more abstract representation, many aspects of factuality (interaction of verb tenses, modal verbs, negation) are not modeled.", 
        "102": "Noisy automatic parses also diminish the positive effect of richer feature representation.", 
        "103": "6 Conclusions and Future Work  We presented an intuitive method for mapping FactBank and MEANTIME onto the UW scale, and presented a novel factuality model which extends TruthTeller and applies it over PropS\u2019 abstraction of dependency trees.",

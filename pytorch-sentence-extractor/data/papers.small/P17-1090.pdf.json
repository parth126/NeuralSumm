        "205": "For discourse features, structure features matter the most.", 
        "206": "For instance, jointly modeling the discourse relation of the parent node along with the current node can lead to better inference.", 
        "207": "An example is that giving more details on the proposal (ELABORATION) tends to lead to POSITIVE feedback.", 
        "208": "Moreover, REQUEST usually appears close to the root of the argument diagram tree, while POSITIVE feedback is usually observed on leaves.", 
        "209": "Adjacency pairs also play an important role for discourse prediction.", 
        "210": "For joint features, features that composite \u201cphrase mentioned in previous turn\u201d and relation POSITIVE feedback or REQUEST yield higher weight, which are indicators for both key phrases and discourse relations.",

        "212": "Error Analysis and Potential Directions.", 
        "213": "Taking a closer look at our prediction results, one major source of incorrect prediction for phrase selection is based on the fact that similar concepts might be expressed in different ways, and our model predicts inconsistently for different variations.", 
        "214": "For example, participants use both \u201cthick\u201d and \u201ctwo centimeters\u201d to talk about the desired shape of a remote control.", 
        "215": "However, our model does not group them into the same cluster and later makes different predictions.", 
        "216": "For future work, semantic similarity with context information can be leveraged to produce better clustering results.", 
        "217": "Furthermore, identifying discourse relations in dialogues is still a challenging task.", 
        "218": "For instance, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t choose a plastic case\u201d should be labeled as OPTION EXCLUSION, if the previous turns talk about different options.",

        "228": "We construct three types of features by using our model\u2019s predicted labels.",

        "2": "POS tagging, parsing, sentiment analysis) mostly work at the word, sentence, or document level, the increased focus on social scientific applications has shifted attention to new levels of analysis (e.g.",

        "6": "Methods performing optimally at the document level may suffer at the user or community level due to this shift in the distribution of lexical features.2\nIn this paper, we ask a fundamental statistical question: How does the shift in unit-of-analysis from document-level to user-or-community level shift lexical distributions in social media?3 The central limit theorem suggests that count data is better approximated by a Normal distribution as one increases the number of events, or as one aggregates more features (e.g.",

        "76": "We consider a Naive Bayes classifier (a generative model) which enables one to directly incorporate the inferred feature distribution at a particular level of analysis, the results of which we discuss in Table 2.", 
        "77": "Variable encoding for the classifiers varied from binary encoding of present or not (Bernoulli), to counts (Poisson, Zero-inflated Poisson), multivariate counts (Multinomial), and continuous relative frequencies (Normal).",

        "82": "We observe a similar pattern as that observed in the goodness of fit setting, with a shift in the best performing distribution from Bernoulli (which simply models if a feature exists or not) toward something more Gaussian (Poisson or Normal) as we move along from message-level to county-level analysis and from unigrams to lexica.", 
        "83": "Specifically note that at higher levels of analysis (at user and county levels) as the distribution of features becomes closer to Normal, modeling features as Bernoulli is clearly sub-optimal where as at the message level modeling unigrams as a Bernoulli is superior.", 
        "84": "These observations underscore the main insight that the distribution family used to model features can be con-\nsidered a function of level of analysis and featuretype considered and has a significant bearing on predictive performance.", 
        "85": "4 Conclusion  While computational linguistics has a long history of studying the distributions of lexical features, social media and social scientific studies have brought about a need to understand how these change at multiple levels of analyses.", 
        "86": "Here, we explored empirical distributions of different types of linguistic features (unigrams, topics, lexica) in three different levels of analysis in Twitter data (message, user, and community).", 
        "87": "To show which distribution can better describe features of different levels, we approached the problem in three different ways: (1) visualization of empirical distributions, (2) goodness-of-fit comparisons, and (3) for predictive tasks.", 
        "88": "We showed that the best-fit distribution depends on feature-type (i.e.", 
        "89": "unigram versus lexica) and the level of analysis (i.e.", 
        "90": "message-, user-, or community-level).", 
        "91": "Following the central limit theorem, all user-level features were predominantly Log-normal, while a power law best fit unigrams at the message level and a Normal distribution best approximated lexica at the community level.", 
        "92": "Finally, we demonstrated that predictive performance can also vary considerably by the level of analysis and feature-type, following a similar trend from Bernoulli distributions at the messagelevel to Poisson or Normal at the community-level.", 
        "93": "Our results underscore the significance of the level of analysis for the ever-growing focus in NLP on social scientific problems which seek to not only better model words and documents but also the people and communities generating them.",

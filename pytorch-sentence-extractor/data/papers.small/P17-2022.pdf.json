        "45": "In each case though, because these patterns are localized to a verb and only one element, they allow us to learn highly specific patterns that could be incorporated into a dictionary such as +- Effect (Choi and Wiebe, 2014).",

        "113": "For example, we find a range of basic state descriptions (have party, have cancer) whose basic entailment category is either possessive or property state.", 
        "114": "Since Ehave is positive for a first-person subject only if the object is positive, and negative if the object is negative, we predict that parties are good to possess and that cancer is a bad property to have.",

        "116": "We find it a welcome result that our semi-supervised methods\nyield patterns that correspond to the A&R classes, thus validating our suspicion that first-person sentences furnish a simplifying test ground for discovering functional patterns in the wild.", 
        "117": "However, many patterns are not covered by A&R\u2019s general classes, see Table 6.", 
        "118": "Looking first at verbs, one major correlation is between positive classes and public events and negative classes and private states.",

        "121": "Verbs from the negative class are strikingly different.",

        "123": "While this state vs. event distinction is not one existing computational models of sentiment or affect discuss explicitly, it replicates a finding that consistently emerges in clinical psychology, one that is explicitly argued for in cognitive-behavioral accounts of the mood that particular activities evoke (Lewinsohn et al., 1985; MacPhillamy and Lewinsohn, 1982; Russo et al., 2015).",

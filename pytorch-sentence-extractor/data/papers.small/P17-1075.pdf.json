        "82": "Based on these assumptions, McNamara and Magliano (2009) proposed two aspects of text comprehension, namely \u201cstrategic/skilled comprehension\u201d and \u201ctext ease of processing.\u201d We adopted these assumptions as the basis of our two classes of evaluation metrics (Section 3).",

        "200": "In the annotation of prerequisite skills, the interannotator agreement was 90.1% for 62 randomly sampled questions.", 
        "201": "The evaluation was performed with respect to the following four aspects: (i) frequencies of prerequisite skills required for each RC dataset; (ii) number of prerequisite skills required per question; (iii) readability metrics for each RC dataset; and (iv) correlation between readability metrics and the number of required prerequisite skills.", 
        "202": "(i) Frequencies of prerequisite skills (see Table 3): QA4MRE had the highest scores for frequencies among the datasets.", 
        "203": "This seems to reflect\nthe fact that QA4MRE involves technical documents that contain a wide range of knowledge, multiple clauses, and punctuation.", 
        "204": "Moreover, the questions are devised by experts.", 
        "205": "MCTest achieved a high score for several skills (best for causal relation and meta-knowledge and second-best for coreference resolution and spatiotemporal relation), but a low score for punctuation.", 
        "206": "These scores seem to be because the MCTest dataset consists of narratives.", 
        "207": "Another dataset that achieved notable scores is Who-did-What.", 
        "208": "This dataset achieved the highest score for ellipsis.", 
        "209": "This is because the questions of Who-did-What are automatically generated from articles not used as context.", 
        "210": "This methodology tends to avoid textual overlap between a question and its context, thereby requiring frequently the skills of ellipsis, bridging, and elaboration.", 
        "211": "With regard to nonsense, MS MARCO and Who-did-What received relatively high scores.", 
        "212": "This appears to have been caused by the automated sourcing methods, which may generate a separation between the contents of the context and question (i.e., web segments and a search query in MS MARCO, and a context article and question article in Who-did-What).", 
        "213": "In contrast, NewsQA had no nonsense questions.", 
        "214": "Although this result was affected by our filtering (described in Appendix A), it is important to note that the NewsQA dataset includes annotations of meta-information whether or not a question makes sense (is question bad).", 
        "215": "(ii) Number of required prerequisite skills (see Table 4): QA4MRE had the highest score.", 
        "216": "On average, each question required 3.25 skills.", 
        "217": "There were few questions in QA4MRE that re-\nquired zero or one skill, whereas such questions were contained more frequently in other datasets.", 
        "218": "Table 4 also indicates that more than 90% of the MS MARCO questions required fewer than three skills according to the annotation.", 
        "219": "(iii) Readability metrics for each dataset (see Table 5): SQuAD and QA4MRE achieved the highest scores for most metrics.", 
        "220": "This reflects the fact that Wikipedia articles and technical documents usually require a high-grade level of understanding.", 
        "221": "In contrast, MCTest had the lowest scores, with its dataset consisting of narratives for children.", 
        "222": "(iv) Correlation between numbers of required prerequisite skills and readability metrics (see Figures 2 and 3, and Table 6): our main interest was in the correlation between prerequisite skills and readability.", 
        "223": "To investigate this, we examined the relation between the number of required prerequisite skills and readability metrics.", 
        "224": "We used the Flesch\u2013Kincaid grade level (Kincaid et al., 1975) as an intuitive reference for readability.", 
        "225": "This value represents the typical number of years of education required to understand texts based on counts of syllables, words, and sentences.",

        "227": "Figure 2 shows the trends of the datasets.", 
        "228": "QA4MRE was relatively difficult both to read and to answer, whereas SQuAD was difficult to read but easy to answer.", 
        "229": "For further investigation, we selected three datasets (QA4MRE, MCTest, and SQuAD) and plotted all of their questions in Figure 3.", 
        "230": "Three separate domains can be seen.", 
        "231": "Table 6 presents Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients between the number of required prerequisite skills and each readability metric for all questions in the RC datasets.", 
        "232": "Although there are weak correlations, from 0.025 to 0.416, these results demonstrate that there is not necessarily a strong correlation between the two values.", 
        "233": "This leads to the following two insights.", 
        "234": "First, the readability of RC datasets does not directly affect the difficulty of their questions.", 
        "235": "That is, RC datasets that are difficult to read are not necessarily difficult to answer.", 
        "236": "Second, it is possible to create difficult questions from the context that are easy to read.", 
        "237": "MCTest is a good example.", 
        "238": "The context texts in the MCTest dataset are easy to read, but the difficulty of its questions compares to that for the other datasets.", 
        "239": "To summarize our results in terms of each RC dataset, we can make the following observations.", 
        "240": "- QA4MRE is difficult both to read and to answer among the datasets analyzed.", 
        "241": "This would seem to follow its questions being devised by experts.", 
        "242": "- MCTest is a good example of an RC dataset that is easy to read but difficult to answer.", 
        "243": "We presume that this is because the corpus genre (i.e., narrative) reflects the trend in required skills for the questions.", 
        "244": "- SQuAD is difficult to read, along with QA4MRE, but relatively easy to answer compared with the other datasets.", 
        "245": "- Who-did-What performs well in terms of its query-sourcing method.", 
        "246": "Although its questions are created automatically, they are sophisticated in terms of knowledge reasoning.", 
        "247": "However, the automated sourcing method must be improved to exclude nonsense questions.", 
        "248": "- MS MARCO is a relatively easy dataset in terms of prerequisite skills.", 
        "249": "However, one problem is that the dataset contained nonsense questions.", 
        "250": "- NewsQA is advantageous in that it provides meta-information on the reliability of the questions.", 
        "251": "Such information enabled us to avoid using nonsense questions, as for the training of machine learning models.", 
        "252": "6 Discussion  In this section, we discuss several issues regarding the construction of RC datasets and the development of RC systems using our methodology.", 
        "253": "How to utilize the two classes of metrics for system development: one possible scenario for developing an RC system is that it is first built to solve an easy-to-read and easy-to-answer dataset.", 
        "254": "The next step would be to improve the system so that it can solve an easy-to-read but difficult-toanswer dataset (or its converse).", 
        "255": "Finally, only after it can solve such datasets should the system be applied to difficult-to-read and difficult-to-answer datasets.", 
        "256": "The metrics of this study may be useful in preparing appropriate datasets for each step by measuring their properties.", 
        "257": "The datasets can then be ordered according to the grades of the metrics and applied to each step of the development, as in curriculum learning (Bengio et al., 2009) and transfer learning (Pan and Yang, 2010).", 
        "258": "Corpus genre: attention should be paid to the genre of the corpus used to construct a dataset.", 
        "259": "Expository documents such as news articles tend to require factorial understanding.", 
        "260": "Most existing RC datasets use such texts because of their availability.", 
        "261": "On the other hand, narrative texts may have a\ncloser correspondence to our everyday experience, involving the emotions and intentions of characters (Graesser et al., 1994).", 
        "262": "To build agents that work in the real world, RC datasets may have to be constructed from narratives.", 
        "263": "Question type: in contrast to factorial understanding, comprehensive understanding of natural language texts needs a better grasp of global coherence (e.g., the main point or moral of the text, the goal of a story, or the intention of characters) from the broad context (Graesser et al., 1994).", 
        "264": "Most questions in current use require only local coherence (e.g., referential relations and thematic roles) within a narrow context.", 
        "265": "An example of a question based on global coherence would be to give a summary of the text, as used in Hermann et al.", 
        "266": "(2015).", 
        "267": "It could be generated automatically by techniques of abstractive text summarization (Rush et al., 2015; Ganesan et al., 2010).", 
        "268": "Annotation issues: we found questions for which there were disagreements regarding nonsense decisions.", 
        "269": "For example, some questions can be solved by external knowledge without even seeing their context.", 
        "270": "Therefore, we should clarify what constitutes a \u201csolvable\u201d or \u201creasonable\u201d question for RC.", 
        "271": "In addition, annotators reported that the prerequisite skills did not easily treat questions whose answer was \u201cnone of the above\u201d in QA4MRE.", 
        "272": "We considered these \u201cno answer\u201d questions difficult, in that systems have to decide not to select any of the candidate answers, and our methodology failed to specify them.", 
        "273": "Competence in selecting necessary sentences: as mentioned in Section 1, our methodology cannot evaluate competence in selecting sentences that need to be read to answer questions.", 
        "274": "In a brief analysis, we further investigated sentences in the context of the datasets that were selected in the annotation.", 
        "275": "Analyses were performed in two ways.", 
        "276": "For each question, we counted the number of required sentences and their distance apart.4 The first row of Table 7 gives the average number of required sentences per question for each RC dataset.", 
        "277": "Although the scores are reasonably close, MCTest required multiple sentences to be read most frequently.", 
        "278": "The second row gives the average dis-\n4The distance of sentences was calculated as follows.", 
        "279": "If a question required only one sentence to be read, its distance was zero.", 
        "280": "If a question required two adjacent sentences to be read, its distance was one.", 
        "281": "If a question required more than two sentences to be read, its distance was the sum of the distances of any two sentences.", 
        "282": "tance apart of the required sentences.", 
        "283": "QA4MRE required the longest distance because readers had to look for clues in the long context texts.", 
        "284": "In contrast, SQuAD and MS MARCO had lower scores.", 
        "285": "Most of their questions seemed to be answered by reading only a single sentence.", 
        "286": "Of course, the scores for distances will depend on the length of the context texts.", 
        "287": "Metrics of RC for machines: our underlying assumption in this study is that, in the development of interactive agents such as dialogue systems, it is important to make the systems behave in a human-like way.", 
        "288": "This has also become a distinguishing feature of recent RC task design, and one that has never been explicitly considered in conventional NLP tasks.", 
        "289": "To date, the difference between human and machine RC has not attracted much research attention.", 
        "290": "We believe that our human-based evaluation metrics and analysis will help researchers to develop a method for the step-by-step construction of better RC datasets and improved RC systems.", 
        "291": "7 Conclusion  In this study, we adopted evaluation metrics that comprise two classes, namely refined prerequisite skills and readability, for analyzing the quality of RC datasets.", 
        "292": "We applied these classes to six existing datasets and highlighted their characteristics according to each metric.", 
        "293": "Our dataset analysis suggests that the readability of RC datasets does not directly affect the difficulty of the questions and that it is possible to create an RC dataset that is easy to read but difficult to answer.",

        "2": "Such systems, which are based on phrasebased MT models that are typically trained on large sets of sentence-correction pairs, can correct global errors such as word order and usage and local errors in spelling and inflection.", 
        "3": "The approach has proven superior to systems based on local classifiers that can only fix focused errors in prepositions, determiners, or inflected forms (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2016).", 
        "4": "\u2217This work was conducted while the third author worked at Microsoft Research.", 
        "5": "Recently, neural machine translation (NMT) systems have achieved substantial improvements in translation quality over phrase-based MT systems (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015).", 
        "6": "Thus, there is growing interest in applying neural systems to GEC (Yuan and Briscoe, 2016; Xie et al., 2016).", 
        "7": "In this paper, we significantly extend previous work, and explore new neural models to meet the unique challenges of GEC.", 
        "8": "The core component of most NMT systems is a sequence-to-sequence (S2S) model which encodes a sequence of source words into a vector and then generates a sequence of target words from the vector.", 
        "9": "Unlike the phrase-based MT models, the S2S model can capture long-distance, or even global, word dependencies, which are crucial to correcting global grammatical errors and helping users achieve native speaker fluency (Sakaguchi et al., 2016).", 
        "10": "Thus, the S2S model is expected to perform better on GEC than phrase-based models.", 
        "11": "However, as we will show in this paper, to achieve the best performance on GEC, we still need to extend the standard S2S model to address several task-specific challenges, which we will describe below.", 
        "12": "First, a GEC model needs to deal with an extremely large vocabulary that consists of a large number of words and their (mis)spelling variations.", 
        "13": "Second, the GEC model needs to capture structure at different levels of granularity in order to correct errors of different types.", 
        "14": "For example, while correcting spelling and local grammar errors requires only word-level or sub-word level information, e.g., violets\u2192 violates (spelling) or violate\u2192 violates (verb form), correcting errors in word order or usage requires global semantic relationships among phrases and words.", 
        "15": "Standard approaches in neural machine translation, also applied to grammatical error correction by Yuan and Briscoe (2016), address the large vocabulary problem by restricting the vocabulary to a limited number of high-frequency words and re-\n753\nsorting to standard word translation dictionaries to provide translations for the words that are out of the vocabulary (OOV).",

        "155": "All models are trained with mini-batch size of 128 (batches are shuffled), initial learning rate of 0.0003 and a 0.95 decay ratio if the cost increases in two consecutive 100 iterations.", 
        "156": "The gradient is rescaled whenever its norm exceeds 10, and dropout is used with a probability of 0.15.", 
        "157": "Parameters are uniformly ini-\ntialized in [\u2212 \u221a\n(3)\u221a 1000 ,\n\u221a (3)\u221a\n1000 ].", 
        "158": "We perform inference on the validation set every 5000 iterations to log word-level cost and characterlevel costs; we save parameter values for the model every 10000 iterations as well as the end of each epoch.", 
        "159": "The stopping point for training is selected based on development set F0.5 among the top 20 parameter sets with best validation set value of the loss function.", 
        "160": "Training of the nested attention hybrid model takes approximately five days on a Tesla k40m GPU.", 
        "161": "The basic hybrid model trains in around four days and the word-level backbone trains in approximately three days.", 
        "162": "Table 3 shows the performance of the baseline and our nested attention hybrid model on the development and test sets.", 
        "163": "In addition to the word-level\nbaseline, we include the performance of a hybrid model with a single level of attention, which follows the work of Luong and Manning (2016) for machine translation, and is the first application of a hybrid word/character-level model to grammatical error correction.", 
        "164": "Based on hyper-parameter selection, the character-level component weight of the loss is \u03b1 = 1 for the basic hybrid model.", 
        "165": "As shown in Table 3, our implementation of the word NMT+UNK replacement baseline approaches the performance of the one reported in Yuan and Briscoe (2016) (38.77 versus 39.9).", 
        "166": "We attribute the difference to differences in the training set and the word-alignment methods used.", 
        "167": "Our reimplementation serves to provide a controlled experimental evaluation of the impact of hybrid models and nested attention on the GEC task.", 
        "168": "As seen, our nested attention hybrid model substantially improves upon the baseline, achieving a gain of close to 3 points on the test set.", 
        "169": "The hybrid word/character model with a single level of attention brings a large improvement as well, showing the importance of character-level information for this task.", 
        "170": "We delve deeper into the impact of nested attention for the hybrid model in Section 5.", 
        "171": "4.4 Integrating a Web-scale Language Model  The value of large language models for grammatical error correction is well known, and such models have been used in classifier and MT-based systems.", 
        "172": "To establish the potential of such models in word-based neural sequence-to-sequence systems, we integrate a web-scale count-based language model.", 
        "173": "In particular, we use the modified Kneser-Ney 5-gram language model trained from Common Crawl (Buck et al., 2014), made available for download by Junczys-Dowmunt and Grundkiewicz (2016).", 
        "174": "Candidates generated by neural models are reranked using the following linear interpolation of log probabilities: sy|x = logPNN (y|x) + \u03bb logPLM (y).", 
        "175": "Here \u03bb is a hyper-parameter that balances the weights of the neural network model and the language model.", 
        "176": "We tuned \u03bb separately\nfor each neural model variant, by exploring values in the range [0.0, 2.0] with step size 0.1, and selecting according to development set F0.5.", 
        "177": "The selected values of \u03bb are: 1.6 for word NMT + UNK replacement and 1.0 for the nested attention model.", 
        "178": "Table 4 shows the impact of the LM when combined with the neural models implemented in this work.", 
        "179": "The table also lists the results reported by Xie et al.", 
        "180": "(2016), for their character-level neural model combined with a large word-level language model.", 
        "181": "Our best results exceed the ones reported in the prior work by more than 4 points, although we should note that Xie et al.", 
        "182": "(2016) used a smaller parallel data set for training.", 
        "183": "5 Analysis  We analyze the impact of sub-word level information and the two nested levels of attention in more detail by looking at the performance of the models on different segments of the data.", 
        "184": "In particular, we analyze the performance of the models on sentences containing OOV source words versus ones without OOV words, and corrections to orthographically similar versus dissimilar word forms.", 
        "185": "5.1 Performance by Segment: OOV versus Non-OOV  We present a comparative performance analysis of models on the CoNLL-13 development set.", 
        "186": "First, we divide the set into two segments: OOV and NonOOV, based on whether there is at least one OOV word in the given source input.", 
        "187": "Table 5 shows that both hybrid architectures substantially outperform the word-level model in both segments of the data.", 
        "188": "The additional nested character-level attention of our hybrid model brings a sizable improvement over the basic hybrid model in the OOV segment and a small degradation in the non-OOV segment.", 
        "189": "We should note that in future work characterlevel attention can be added for non-OOV source words in the nested attention model, which could improve performance on this segment as well.", 
        "190": "Table 6 shows an example where the nested attention hybrid model successfully corrects a misspelling resulting in an OOV word on the source, whereas the baseline word-level system simply copies the source word without fixing the error (since this particular error is not observed in the parallel training set).", 
        "191": "5.2 Impact of Nested Attention on Different Error Types  To analyze more precisely the impact of the additional character-level attention introduced by our design, we continue to investigate the OOV segment in more detail.", 
        "192": "The concept of edit, which is also used by the official M2 score metric, is defined as a minimal pair of corresponding sub-strings in a source sentence and a correction.", 
        "193": "For example, in the sentence fragment pair: \u201cEven though there is a risk of causing harms to someone, people still are prefers to keep their pets without a leash.\u201d \u2192 \u201cEven though there is a risk of causing harm to someone, people still prefer to keep their pets without a leash.\u201d, the minimal edits are \u201charms\u2192 harm\u201d and \u201care prefers\u2192 prefer\u201d.", 
        "194": "The F0.5 score is computed using weighted precision and recall of the set of a system\u2019s edits against one or more sets of reference edits.", 
        "195": "For our in-depth analysis, we classify edits in the OOV segment into two types: small changes and large changes, based on whether the source and target phrase of the edit are orthographically similar or not.", 
        "196": "More specifically, we say that the target and\nsource phrases are orthographically similar, iff: the character edit distance is at most 2 and the source or target is at most 8 characters long, or edit ratio < 0.25, where edit ratio = character edit distancemin(len(src),len(tar))+0.1 , len(\u2217) denotes number of characters in \u2217, and src and tgt denote the pairs in the edit.", 
        "197": "There are 307 gold edits in the \u201csmall changes\u201d portion of the CoNLL-13 OOV segment, and 481 gold edits in the \u201clarge changes\u201d portion.", 
        "198": "Our hypothesis is that the additional characterlevel attention layer is particularly useful to model edits among orthographically similar words.", 
        "199": "Table 7 contrasts the impact of character-level attention on the two portions of the data.", 
        "200": "We can see that the gains in the \u201csmall changes\u201d portion are indeed quite large, indicating that the fine-grained character-level attention empowers the model to more accurately correct confusions among phrases with high character-level similarity.", 
        "201": "The impact in the \u201clarge changes\u201d portion is slightly positive in precision and slightly negative in recall.", 
        "202": "Thus most of the benefit of the additional character-level attention stems from improvements in the \u201csmall changes\u201d portion.", 
        "203": "Table 8 shows an example input which illustrates the precision gain of the nested attention hybrid model.", 
        "204": "The input sentence has a source OOV word which is correct.", 
        "205": "The hybrid model introduces an error in this word, because it uses only a single source context vector, aggregating the characterlevel embedding of the source OOV word together with other source words.", 
        "206": "The additional characterlevel attention layer in the nested hybrid model enables the correct copying of this long source OOV word, without employing the heuristic mechanism of the word-level NMT system.", 
        "207": "6 Conclusions  We have introduced a novel hybrid neural model with two nested levels of attention: word-level and character-level.", 
        "208": "The model addresses the unique challenges of the grammatical error correction task and achieves the best reported results on the CoNLL-14 benchmark among fully neural systems.", 
        "209": "Our nested attention hybrid model deeply combines the strengths of word and character level information in all components of an end-to-end neural model: the encoder, the attention layers, and the decoder.", 
        "210": "This enables it to correct both global wordlevel and local character-level errors in a unified way.", 
        "211": "The new architecture contributes substantial improvement in correction of confusions among rare or orthographically similar words compared to word-level sequence-to-sequence and non-nested hybrid models.", 
        "212": "Acknowledgements  We would like to thank the ACL reviewers for their insightful suggestions, Victoria Zayats for her help with reproducing the baseline word-level NMT system and Yu Shi, Daxin Jiang and Michael Zeng for the helpful discussions."

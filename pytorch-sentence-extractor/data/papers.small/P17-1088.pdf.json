        "2": "However, knowledge bases suffer from incompleteness despite their formidable sizes (Socher et al., 2013; West et al., 2014), leading to a number of studies on automatic knowledge base completion (KBC) (Nickel et al., 2015) or link prediction.", 
        "3": "The fundamental motivation behind these studies is that there exist some statistical regularities under the intertwined facts stored in the multirelational knowledge base.",

        "9": "Implicitly, TransE assumes both entity embeddings and relation embeddings dwell in the same vector space, posing an unnecessarily strong prior.", 
        "10": "To relax this requirement, a variety of models first project the entity embeddings to a relationdependent space (Bordes et al., 2014; Ji et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2015b; Nguyen et al., 2016b), and then model the translation property in the projected space.", 
        "11": "Typically, these relation-dependent spaces are characterized by the projection matrices unique to each relation.",

        "14": "Despite the superior performance of STransE compared to TransE, it is more prone to the data sparsity problem.", 
        "15": "Concretely, since the projection spaces are unique to each relation, projection matrices associated with rare relations can only be exposed to very few facts during training, resulting in poor generalization.", 
        "16": "For common relations, a similar issue exists.",

        "19": "In parallel, recent work has proposed to model regularities beyond local facts by considering multirelation paths (Garc\u0131\u0301a-Dura\u0301n et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2015a; Shen et al., 2016).", 
        "20": "Since the number of paths grows exponentially with its length, as a side effect, path-based models enjoy much more training cases, suffering less from the problem.",

        "23": "Without any external resources, ITransF improves mean rank and Hits@10 on two benchmark datasets, over all previous approaches of the same kind.", 
        "24": "In addition, the parameter sharing is clearly indicated by the learned sparse attention vectors, enabling us to interpret how knowledge transfer is carried out.",

        "26": "In summary, the contributions of this work are: (i) proposing a novel knowledge embedding model which enables knowledge transfer by learning to discover shared regularities; (ii) introducing a learning algorithm to directly optimize a sparse representation from which the knowledge transferring procedure is interpretable; (iii) showing the effectiveness of our model by outperforming baselines on two benchmark datasets for knowledge base completion task.",

        "29": "Most of the embedding models for knowledge base completion define an energy function fr(h, t)\naccording to the fact\u2019s plausibility (Bordes et al., 2011, 2014, 2013; Socher et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2015; Guu et al., 2015; Nguyen et al., 2016b).", 
        "30": "The models are learned to minimize energy fr(h, t) of a plausible triple (h, r, t) and to maximize energy fr(h\u2032, t\u2032) of an implausible triple (h\u2032, r, t\u2032).", 
        "31": "Motivated by the linear translation phenomenon observed in well trained word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013), TransE (Bordes et al., 2013) represents the head entity h, the relation r and the tail entity t with vectors h, r and t \u2208 Rn respectively, which were trained so that h+r \u2248 t. They define the energy function as\nfr(h, t) = \u2016h+ r\u2212 t\u2016` where ` = 1 or 2, which means either the `1 or the `2 norm of the vector h + r \u2212 t will be used depending on the performance on the validation set.", 
        "32": "To better model relation-specific aspects of the same entity, TransR (Lin et al., 2015b) uses projection matrices and projects the head entity and the tail entity to a relation-dependent space.", 
        "33": "STransE (Nguyen et al., 2016b) extends TransR by employing different matrices for mapping the head and the tail entity.", 
        "34": "The energy function is\nfr(h, t) = \u2016Wr,1h+ r\u2212Wr,2t\u2016` However, not all relations have abundant data to estimate the relation specific matrices as most of the training samples are associated with only a few relations, leading to the data sparsity problem for rare relations.", 
        "35": "3 Interpretable Knowledge Transfer    3.1 Model  As discussed above, a fundamental weakness in TransR and STransE is that they equip each relation with a set of unique projection matrices, which not only introduces more parameters but also hinders knowledge sharing.", 
        "36": "Intuitively, many relations share some concepts with each other, although they are stored as independent symbols in KB.", 
        "37": "For example, the relation \u201c(somebody) won award for (some work)\u201d and \u201c(somebody) was nominated for (some work)\u201d both describe a person\u2019s high-quality work which wins an award or a nomination respectively.", 
        "38": "This phenomenon suggests that one relation actually represents a collection of real-world concepts, and one concept\ncan be shared by several relations.", 
        "39": "Inspired by the existence of such lower-level concepts, instead of defining a unique set of projection matrices for every relation, we can alternatively define a small set of concept projection matrices and then compose them into customized projection matrices.", 
        "40": "Effectively, the relation-dependent translation space is then reduced to the smaller concept spaces.", 
        "41": "However, in general, we do not have prior knowledge about what concepts exist out there and how they are composed to form relations.", 
        "42": "Therefore, in ITransF, we propose to learn this information simultaneously from data, together with all knowledge embeddings.", 
        "43": "Following this idea, we first present the model details, then discuss the optimization techniques for training.", 
        "44": "Energy function Specifically, we stack all the concept projection matrices to a 3-dimensional tensor D \u2208 Rm\u00d7n\u00d7n, wherem is the pre-specified number of concept projection matrices and n is the dimensionality of entity embeddings and relation embeddings.", 
        "45": "We let each relation select the most useful projection matrices from the tensor, where the selection is represented by an attention vector.",

        "47": "It is obvious that STransE can be expressed as a special case of our model when we use m = 2|R| concept matrices and set attention vectors to disjoint one-hot vectors.", 
        "48": "Hence our model space is a generalization of STransE.", 
        "49": "Note that we can safely use fewer concept matrices in ITransF and obtain better performance (see section 4.3), though STransE always requires 2|R| projection matrices.", 
        "50": "We follow previous work to minimize the following hinge loss function:\nL = \u2211\n(h,r,t)\u223cP, (h\u2032,r,t\u2032)\u223cN\n[ \u03b3 + fr(h, t)\u2212 fr(h\u2032, t\u2032) ] + (2)\nwhere P is the training set consisting of correct triples, N is the distribution of corrupted triples defined in section 3.3, and [\u00b7]+ = max(\u00b7, 0).",

        "53": "Sparse attention vectors In Eq.", 
        "54": "(1), we have defined \u03b1Hr ,\u03b1 T r to be some normalized vectors used for composition.", 
        "55": "With a dense attention vector, it is computationally expensive to perform the convex combination of m matrices in each iteration.", 
        "56": "Moreover, a relation usually does not consist of all existing concepts in practice.", 
        "57": "Furthermore, when the attention vectors are sparse, it is often easier to interpret their behaviors and understand how concepts are shared by different relations.", 
        "58": "Motivated by these potential benefits, we further hope to learn sparse attention vectors in ITransF.", 
        "59": "However, directly posing `1 regularization (Tibshirani, 1996) on the attention vectors fails to produce sparse representations in our preliminary experiment, which motivates us to enforce `0 constraints on \u03b1Tr ,\u03b1 H r .", 
        "60": "In order to satisfy both the normalization condition and the `0 constraints, we reparameterize the attention vectors in the following way:\n\u03b1Hr = SparseSoftmax(v H r , I H r ) \u03b1Tr = SparseSoftmax(v T r , I T r )\nwhere vHr ,v T r \u2208 Rm are the pre-softmax scores, IHr , I T r \u2208 {0, 1}m are the sparse assignment vectors, indicating the non-zero entries of attention vectors, and the SparseSoftmax is defined as\nSparseSoftmax(v, I)i = exp(vi/\u03c4)Ii\u2211 j exp(vj/\u03c4)Ij\nwith \u03c4 being the temperature of Softmax.", 
        "61": "With this reparameterization, vHr ,v T r and IHr , I T r replace \u03b1 T r ,\u03b1 H r to become the real parameters of the model.", 
        "62": "Also, note that it is equivalent to pose the `0 constraints on IHr , I T r instead of \u03b1Tr ,\u03b1 H r .", 
        "63": "Putting these modifications together, we can rewrite the optimization problem as\nminimize L subject to \u2016IHr \u20160 \u2264 k, \u2016ITr \u20160 \u2264 k\n(3)\nwhere L is the loss function defined in Eq.", 
        "64": "(2).", 
        "65": "3.2 Block Iterative Optimization  Though sparseness is favorable in practice, it is generally NP-hard to find the optimal solution under `0 constraints.", 
        "66": "Thus, we resort to an approximated algorithm in this work.", 
        "67": "For convenience, we refer to the parameters with and without the sparse constraints as the sparse partition and the dense partition, respectively.", 
        "68": "Based on this notion, the high-level idea of the approximated algorithm is to iteratively optimize one of the two partitions while holding the other one fixed.", 
        "69": "Since all parameters in the dense partition, including the embeddings, the projection matrices, and the pre-softmax scores, are fully differentiable with the sparse partition fixed, we can simply utilize SGD to optimize the dense partition.", 
        "70": "Then, the core difficulty lies in the step of optimizing the sparse partition (i.e.", 
        "71": "the sparse assignment vectors), during which we want the following two properties to hold\n1. the sparsity required by the `0 constaint is maintained, and\n2. the cost define by Eq.", 
        "72": "(2) is decreased.", 
        "73": "Satisfying the two criterion seems to highly resemble the original problem defined in Eq.", 
        "74": "(3).", 
        "75": "However, the dramatic difference here is that with parameters in the dense partition regarded as constant, the cost function is decoupled w.r.t.", 
        "76": "each relation r. In other words, the optimal choice of IHr , I T r is independent of I H r\u2032 , I T r\u2032 for any r\n\u2032 6= r. Therefore, we only need to consider the optimization for a single relation r, which is essentially an assignment problem.", 
        "77": "Note that, however, IHr and ITr are still coupled, without which we basically reach the situation in a backpack problem.", 
        "78": "In principle, one can explore combinatorial optimization techniques to optimize IHr\u2032 , I T r\u2032 jointly, which usually involve some iterative procedure.", 
        "79": "To avoid adding another inner loop to our algorithm, we turn to a simple but fast approximation method based on the following single-matrix cost.", 
        "80": "Specifically, for each relation r, we consider the induced cost LHr,i where only a single projection matrix i is used for the head entity:\nLHr,i = \u2211\n(h,r,t)\u223cPr, (h\u2032,r,t\u2032)\u223cNr\n[ \u03b3 + fHr,i(h, t)\u2212 fHr,i(h\u2032, t\u2032) ] +\nwhere fHr,i(h, t) = \u2016Di \u00b7 h + r \u2212 \u03b1Tr \u00b7 D \u00b7 t\u2016 is the corresponding energy function, and the subscript in Pr and Nr denotes the subsets with relation r. Intuitively, LHr,i measures, given the current tail attention vector \u03b1Tr , if only one project matrix could be chosen for the head entity, how implausible Di would be.", 
        "81": "Hence, i\u2217 = argmini LHr,i gives\nus the best single projection matrix on the head side given \u03b1Tr .", 
        "82": "Now, in order to choose the best k matrices, we basically ignore the interaction among projection matrices, and update IHr in the following way:\nIHr,i \u2190 { 1, i \u2208 argpartitioni(LHr,i, k) 0, otherwise\nwhere the function argpartitioni(xi, k) produces the index set of the lowest-k values of xi.", 
        "83": "Analogously, we can define the single-matrix cost LTr,i and the energy function fTr,i(h, t) on the tail side in a symmetric way.", 
        "84": "Then, the update rule for IHr follows the same derivation.", 
        "85": "Admittedly, the approximation described here is relatively crude.", 
        "86": "But as we will show in section 4, the proposed algorithm yields good performance empirically.", 
        "87": "We leave the further improvement of the optimization method as future work.", 
        "88": "3.3 Corrupted Sample Generating Method  Recall that we need to sample a negative triple (h\u2032, r, t\u2032) to compute hinge loss shown in Eq.",

        "92": "However, uniformly sampling corrupted entities may not be optimal.", 
        "93": "Often, the head and tail entities associated a relation can only belong to a specific domain.", 
        "94": "When the corrupted entity comes from other domains, it is very easy for the model to induce a large energy gap between true triple and corrupted one.", 
        "95": "As the energy gap exceeds \u03b3, there will be no training signal from this corrupted triple.", 
        "96": "In comparison, if the corrupted entity comes from the same domain, the task becomes harder for the model, leading to more consistent training signal.",

        "2": "Recently, neural models have provided a powerful tool for learning how to compose words together into a meaning representation of whole sentences for many downstream tasks.", 
        "3": "This is done using models of various levels of sophistication, from simpler bag-of-words (Iyyer et al., 2015) and linear recurrent neural network (RNN) models (Sutskever et al., 2014; Kiros et al., 2015), to more sophisticated models using tree-\nstructured (Socher et al., 2013) or convolutional networks (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014).", 
        "4": "In fact, a growing body of evidence shows that it is essential to look below the word-level and consider compositionality within words themselves.", 
        "5": "For example, several works have proposed models that represent words by composing together the characters into a representation of the word itself (Ling et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015; Dhingra et al., 2016).", 
        "6": "Additionally, for languages with productive word formation (such as agglutination and compounding), models calculating morphologysensitive word representations have been found effective (Luong et al., 2013; Botha and Blunsom, 2014).", 
        "7": "These models help to learn more robust representations for rare words by exploiting morphological patterns, as opposed to models that operate purely on the lexical level as the atomic units.", 
        "8": "For many languages, compositionality stops at the character-level: characters are atomic units of meaning or pronunciation in the language, and no further decomposition can be done.1 However, for other languages, character-level compositionality, where a character\u2019s meaning or pronunciation can\n1In English, for example, this is largely the case.",

        "18": "In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of modeling the compositionality of characters in a way similar to how humans do: by visually observing the character and using the features of its shape to learn a representation encoding its meaning.", 
        "19": "Our method is relatively simple, and generalizable to a wide variety of languages: we first transform each character from its Unicode representation to a rendering of its shape as an image, then calculate a representation of the image using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (Cun et al., 1990).", 
        "20": "These features then serve as inputs to a down-stream processing task and trained in an end-to-end manner, which first calculates a loss function, then back-propagates the loss back to the CNN.",

        "23": "1, in logographic languages character-level semantic or phonetic similarity is often indicated by visual cues; we conjecture that CNNs can appropriately model these visual patterns.", 
        "24": "Consequently, characters with similar visual appearances will be biased to have similar embeddings, allowing our model to handle rare characters effectively, just as character-level models have been effective for rare words.",

        "30": "Specifically, the dataset must satisfy two desiderata: (1) it must be necessary to fully utilize each character in the input in order to achieve high accuracy, and (2) there must be enough regularity and com-\npositionality in the characters of the language.", 
        "31": "To satisfy these desiderata, we create a text classification dataset where the input is a Wikipedia article title in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean, and the output is the category to which the article belongs.3 This satisfies (1), because Wikipedia titles are short and thus each character in the title will be important to our decision about its category.",

        "98": "The results in Tab.", 
        "99": "3 show that the baseline model performs 1-2% better across four datasets; this is due to the fact that the LOOKUP model can directly learn character embeddings that capture the semantics of each character symbol for frequent characters.",

        "101": "This is an advantage for rare characters, but a disadvantage for high frequency characters because being similar in appearance does not always lead to similar semantics.", 
        "102": "To demonstrate that this is in fact the case, besides looking at the overall classification accuracy, we also examine the performance on classifying low frequency instances which are sorted according to the average training set frequency of the characters therein.",

        "117": "As we can see in Fig.", 
        "118": "4, the intersection point for 100% training data lies between the intersection point for 50% training data and 12.5%.", 
        "119": "This disagrees with our hypothesis; this is likely because while the number of low-frequency characters increases, smaller amounts of data also adversely impact the ability of CNN to learn useful visual features, and thus there is not a clear gain nor loss when using the proposed method.", 
        "120": "As a more extreme test of the ability of our proposed framework to deal with the unseen char-\nacters in the test set, we use traditional Chinese as our training data and simplified Chinese as our testing data.",

        "169": "These works inspire us to use CNN to extract features from image and serve as the input to the RNN.", 
        "170": "Our model is able to directly back-propagate the gradient all the way through the CNN, which generates visual embeddings, in a way such that the embedding can contain both semantic and visual information.", 
        "171": "Several techniques for reducing the rare words effects have been introduced in the literature, including spelling expansion (Habash, 2008), dictionary term expansion (Habash, 2008), proper name transliteration (Daume\u0301 and Jagarlamudi, 2011), treating words as a sequence of characters (Luong and Manning, 2016), subword units (Sennrich et al., 2015), and reading text as bytes (Gillick et al., 2015).", 
        "172": "However, most of these techniques still have no mechanism for handling low frequency characters, which are the target of this work.", 
        "173": "Finally, there are works on improving embeddings with radicals, which explicitly splits Chinese characters into radicals based on a dictionary\nof what radicals are included in which characters (Li et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2015; Yin et al., 2016).", 
        "174": "The motivation of this method is similar to ours, but is only applicable to Chinese, in contrast to the method in this paper, which works on any language for which we can render text.", 
        "175": "7 Conclusion and Future Work  In this paper, we proposed a new framework that utilizes appearance of characters, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks to learn embeddings that are compositional in the component parts of the characters.", 
        "176": "More specifically, we collected a Wikipedia dataset, which consists of short titles of three different languages and satisfies the compositionality in the characters of the language.", 
        "177": "Next, we proposed an end-to-end model that learns visual embeddings for characters using CNN and showed that the features extracted from the CNN include both visual and semantic information.", 
        "178": "Furthermore, we showed that our VISUAL model outperforms the LOOKUP baseline model in low frequency instances.", 
        "179": "Additionally, by examining the character embeddings visually, we found that our VISUAL model is able to learn visually related embeddings.", 
        "180": "In summary, we tackled the problem of rare characters by using embeddings learned from images.", 
        "181": "In the future, we hope to further generalize this method to other tasks such as pronunciation estimation, which can take advantage of the fact that pronunciation information is encoded in parts of the characters as demonstrated in Fig.", 
        "182": "1, or machine translation, which could benefit from a wholistic view that considers both semantics and pronunciation.", 
        "183": "We also hope to apply the model to other languages with complicated compositional writing systems, potentially including historical texts such as hieroglyphics or cuneiform.", 
        "184": "Acknowledgments  We thank Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Adhiguna Kuncoro, Chen-Hsuan Lin, Wei-Cheng Chang, Wei-Ning Hsu and the anonymous reviewers for their enlightening comments and feedbacks."

        "153": "Next we look at the question of how to gate intermediate document reader states from the query, i.e.", 
        "154": "what operation to use in equation 6.", 
        "155": "Table\n2 (top) shows the performance on WDW dataset for three common choices \u2013 sum (x = d + q), concatenate (x = d\u2016q) and multiply (x = d q).", 
        "156": "Empirically we find element-wise multiplication does significantly better than the other two, which justifies our motivation to \u201cfilter\u201d out document features which are irrelevant to the query.", 
        "157": "At the bottom of Table 2 we show the effect of varying the number of hops K of the GA Reader on the final performance.", 
        "158": "We note that for K = 1, our model is equivalent to the AS Reader without any GA modules.", 
        "159": "We see a steep and steady rise in accuracy as the number of hops is increased from K = 1 to 3, which remains constant beyond\nthat.", 
        "160": "This is a common trend in machine learning as model complexity is increased, however we note that a multi-hop architecture is important to achieve a high performance for this task, and provide further evidence for this in the next section.", 
        "161": "4.4 Ablation Study for Model Components  Table 4 shows accuracy on WDW by removing one component at a time.", 
        "162": "The steepest reduction is observed when we replace pretrained GloVe vectors with those pretrained on the corpus itself.", 
        "163": "GloVe vectors were trained on a large corpus of about 6 billion tokens (Pennington et al., 2014), and provide an important source of prior knowl-\nedge for the model.", 
        "164": "Note that the strongest baseline on WDW, NSE (Munkhdalai & Yu, 2017b), also uses pretrained GloVe vectors, hence the comparison is fair in that respect.", 
        "165": "Next, we observe a substantial drop when removing tokenspecific attentions over the query in the GA module, which allow gating individual tokens in the document only by parts of the query relevant to that token rather than the overall query representation.", 
        "166": "Finally, removing the character embeddings, which were only used for WDW and CBT, leads to a reduction of about 1% in the performance.", 
        "167": "4.5 Attention Visualization  To gain an insight into the reading process employed by the model we analyzed the attention distributions at intermediate layers of the reader.", 
        "168": "Figure 3 shows an example from the validation set of WDW dataset (several more are in the Appendix).", 
        "169": "In each figure, the left and middle plots visualize attention over the query (equation 5) for candidates in the document after layers 1 & 2 respectively.", 
        "170": "The right plot shows attention over candi-\ndates in the document of cloze placeholder (XXX) in the query at the final layer.", 
        "171": "The full document, query and correct answer are shown at the bottom.", 
        "172": "A generic pattern observed in these examples is that in intermediate layers, candidates in the document (shown along rows) tend to pick out salient tokens in the query which provide clues about the cloze, and in the final layer the candidate with the highest match with these tokens is selected as the answer.", 
        "173": "In Figure 3 there is a high attention of the correct answer on financial regulatory standards in the first layer, and on us president in the second layer.", 
        "174": "The incorrect answer, in contrast, only attends to one of these aspects, and hence receives a lower score in the final layer despite the n-gram overlap it has with the cloze token in the query.", 
        "175": "Importantly, different layers tend to focus on different tokens in the query, supporting the hypothesis that the multihop architecture of GA Reader is able to combine distinct pieces of information to answer the query.", 
        "176": "5 Conclusion  We presented the Gated-Attention reader for answering cloze-style questions over documents.", 
        "177": "The GA reader features a novel multiplicative gating mechanism, combined with a multi-hop architecture.", 
        "178": "Our model achieves the state-of-theart performance on several large-scale benchmark datasets with more than 4% improvements over competitive baselines.", 
        "179": "Our model design is backed up by an ablation study showing statistically significant improvements of using Gated Attention as information filters.", 
        "180": "We also showed empirically that multiplicative gating is superior to addi-\ntion and concatenation operations for implementing gated-attentions, though a theoretical justification remains part of future research goals.", 
        "181": "Analysis of document and query attentions in intermediate layers of the reader further reveals that the model iteratively attends to different aspects of the query to arrive at the final answer.", 
        "182": "In this paper we have focused on text comprehension, but we believe that the Gated-Attention mechanism may benefit other tasks as well where multiple sources of information interact.",

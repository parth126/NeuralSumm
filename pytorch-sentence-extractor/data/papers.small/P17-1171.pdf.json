        "158": "5.3 Full Wikipedia Question Answering  Finally, we assess the performance of our full system DrQA for answering open-domain questions using the four datasets introduced in Section 4.", 
        "159": "We compare three versions of DrQA which evaluate the impact of using distant supervision and multitask learning across the training sources provided to Document Reader (Document Retriever remains the same for each case):\n\u2022 SQuAD: A single Document Reader model is trained on the SQuAD training set only and used on all evaluation sets.", 
        "160": "\u2022 Fine-tune (DS): A Document Reader model is pre-trained on SQuAD and then fine-tuned for each dataset independently using its distant supervision (DS) training set.", 
        "161": "\u2022 Multitask (DS): A single Document Reader model is jointly trained on the SQuAD training set and all the DS sources.", 
        "162": "For the full Wikipedia setting we use a streamlined model that does not use the CoreNLP parsed ftoken features or lemmas for fexact match.", 
        "163": "We\nfind that while these help for more exact paragraph reading in SQuAD, they don\u2019t improve results in the full setting.", 
        "164": "Additionally, WebQuestions and WikiMovies provide a list of candidate answers (e.g., 1.6 million Freebase entity strings for WebQuestions) and we restrict the answer span must be in this list during prediction.", 
        "165": "Results Table 6 presents the results.", 
        "166": "Despite the difficulty of the task compared to machine comprehension (where you are given the right paragraph) and unconstrained QA (using redundant resources), DrQA still provides reasonable performance across all four datasets.", 
        "167": "We are interested in a single, full system that can answer any question using Wikipedia.", 
        "168": "The single model trained only on SQuAD is outperformed on all four of the datasets by the multitask model that uses distant supervision.", 
        "169": "However performance when training on SQuAD alone is not far behind, indicating that task transfer is occurring.", 
        "170": "The majority of the improvement from SQuAD to Multitask (DS) however is likely not from task transfer as fine-tuning on each dataset alone using DS also gives improvements, showing that is is the introduction of extra data in the same domain that helps.", 
        "171": "Nevertheless, the best single model that we can find is our overall goal, and that is the Multitask (DS) system.", 
        "172": "We compare to an unconstrained QA system using redundant resources (not just Wikipedia), YodaQA (Baudis\u030c, 2015), giving results which were previously reported on CuratedTREC and WebQuestions.", 
        "173": "Despite the increased difficulty of our task, it is reassuring that our performance is not too far behind on CuratedTREC (31.3 vs. 25.4).", 
        "174": "The gap is slightly bigger on WebQuestions, likely because this dataset was created from the specific structure of Freebase which YodaQA uses directly.", 
        "175": "DrQA\u2019s performance on SQuAD compared to its Document Reader component on machine comprehension in Table 4 shows a large drop (from 69.5 to 27.1) as we now are given Wikipedia to read, not a single paragraph.", 
        "176": "Given the correct document (but not the paragraph) we can achieve 49.4, indicating many false positives come from highly topical sentences.", 
        "177": "This is despite the fact that the Document Retriever works relatively well (77.8% of the time retrieving the answer, see Table 3).", 
        "178": "It is worth noting that a large part of the drop comes from the nature of the SQuAD questions.", 
        "179": "They were written with a specific paragraph in mind, thus their language can be ambiguous when the context is removed.", 
        "180": "Additional resources other than SQuAD, specifically designed for MRS, might be needed to go further.", 
        "181": "6 Conclusion  We studied the task of machine reading at scale, by using Wikipedia as the unique knowledge source for open-domain QA.", 
        "182": "Our results indicate that MRS is a key challenging task for researchers to focus on.", 
        "183": "Machine comprehension systems alone cannot solve the overall task.", 
        "184": "Our method integrates search, distant supervision, and multitask learning to provide an effective complete system.", 
        "185": "Evaluating the individual components as well as the full system across multiple benchmarks showed the efficacy of our approach.", 
        "186": "Future work should aim to improve over our DrQA system.", 
        "187": "Two obvious angles of attack are: (i) incorporate the fact that Document Reader aggregates over multiple paragraphs and documents directly in the training, as it currently trains on paragraphs independently; and (ii) perform endto-end training across the Document Retriever and Document Reader pipeline, rather than independent systems.",

        "144": "When training the target-language classifier by matching soft labels on the parallel corpus, we also adapt the classifier to the target testing documents.", 
        "145": "We use cross-entropy loss functions as Ly and Ld for both feature adaptation.", 
        "146": "5 Experiments and Discussions    5.1 Dataset  Our experiments used two benchmark datasets, as described below.", 
        "147": "(1) Amazon Reviews\nWe used the multilingual multi-domain Amazon review dataset created by Prettenhofer and Stein (Prettenhofer and Stein, 2010).", 
        "148": "The dataset contains Amazon reviews in three domains: book, DVD and music.", 
        "149": "Each domain has the reviews in four different languages: English, German, French and Japanese.", 
        "150": "We treated English as the source language and the rest three as the target languages, respectively.", 
        "151": "This gives us 9 tasks (the product of the 3 domains and the 3 target languages) in total.", 
        "152": "For each task, there are 1000 positive and 1000 negative reviews in English and the target language, respectively.", 
        "153": "(Prettenhofer and Stein, 2010) also provides 2000 parallel reviews per task,\nthat were generated using Google Translate 1, and used by us for cross-language distillation.", 
        "154": "There are also several thousands of unlabeled reviews in each language.", 
        "155": "The statistics of unlabeled data is summarized in Table 1.", 
        "156": "All the reviews are tokenized using standard regular expressions except for Japanese, for which we used a publicly available segmenter 2.", 
        "157": "(2) English-Chinese Yelp Hotel Reviews This dataset was firstly used for CLTC by (Chen et al., 2016).", 
        "158": "The task is to make sentence-level sentiment classification with 5 labels(rating scale from 1 to 5), using English as the source language and Chinese as the target language.", 
        "159": "The labeled English data consists of balanced labels of 650k Yelp reviews from Zhang et al.", 
        "160": "(Zhang et al., 2015).", 
        "161": "The Chinese data includes 20k labeled Chinese hotel reviews and 1037k unlabeled ones from (Lin et al., 2015).", 
        "162": "Following the approach by (Chen et al., 2016), we use 10k of labeled Chinese data as validation set and another 10k hotel reviews as held-out test data.", 
        "163": "We a random sample of 500k parallel sentences from UM-courpus(Tian et al., 2014), which is a general-purpose corpus designed for machine translation.", 
        "164": "5.2 Baselines  We compare the proposed method with other stateof-the-art methods as outlined below.", 
        "165": "(1) Parallel-Corpus based CLTC Methods Methods in this category all use an unlabeled parallel corpus.", 
        "166": "Methods named PL-LSI (Littman\n1translate.google.com 2https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tinysegmenter\net al., 1998), PL-OPCA (Platt et al., 2010) and PL-KCAA (Vinokourov et al., 2002) learn latent document representations in a shared lowdimensional space by performing the Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), the Oriented Principal Component Analysis (OPCA) and a kernel (namely KCAA) for the parallel text.", 
        "167": "PL-MC (Xiao and Guo, 2013) recovers missing features via matrix Completion, and also uses LSI to induce a latent space for parallel text.", 
        "168": "All these methods train a classifier in the shared feature space with labeled training data from both the source and target languages.", 
        "169": "(2) MT-based CLTC Methods The methods in this category all use an MT system to translate each test document in the target language to the source language in the testing phase.", 
        "170": "The prediction on each translated document is made by a source-language classifier, which can be a Logistic Regression model (MT+LR) (Chen et al., 2016) or a deep averaging network (MT+DAN) (Chen et al., 2016).", 
        "171": "(3) Adversarial Deep Averaging Network Similar to our approach, the adversarial Deep Averaging Network (ADAN) also exploits adversarial training for CLTC (Chen et al., 2016).", 
        "172": "However, it does not have the parallel-corpus based knowledge distillation part (which we do).", 
        "173": "Instead, it uses averaged bilingual embeddings of words as its input and adapts the feature extractor to produce similar features in both languages.", 
        "174": "We also include the results of mSDA for the Yelp Hotel Reviews dataset.", 
        "175": "mSDA (Chen et al., 2012) is a domain adaptation method based on\nstacked denoising autoencoders, which has been proved to be effective in cross-domain sentiment classification evaluations.", 
        "176": "We show the results reported by (Chen et al., 2012), where they used bilingual word embedding as input for mSDA.", 
        "177": "5.3 Implementation Detail  We pre-trained both the source and target classifier with unlabeled data in each language.", 
        "178": "We ran word2vec(Mikolov et al., 2013) 3 on the tokenized unlabeled corpus.", 
        "179": "The learned word embeddings are used to initialize the word embedding look-up matrix, which maps input words to word embeddings and concatenates them into input matrix.", 
        "180": "We fine-tuned the source-language classifier on the English training data with 5-fold crossvalidation.", 
        "181": "For English-Chinese Yelp-hotel review dataset, the temperature T (Section 4.1) in distillation is tuned on validation set in the target language.", 
        "182": "For Amazon review dataset, since there is no default validation set, we set temperature from low to high in {1, 3, 5, 10} and take the average among all predictions.", 
        "183": "3https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/  5.4 Main Results  In tables 2 and 3 we compare the results of our methods (the vanilla version CLD-KCNN and the full version CLDFA-KCNN) with those of other methods based on the published results in the literature.", 
        "184": "The baseline methods are different in these two tables as they were previously evaluated (by their authors) on different benchmark datasets.", 
        "185": "Clearly, CLDFA-KCNN outperformed the other methods on all except one task in these two datasets, showing that knowledge distillation is successfully carried out in our approach.", 
        "186": "Noticing that CLDFA-KCNN outperformed CLD-KCNN, showing the effectiveness of adversarial feature extraction in reducing the distribution mismatch between the parallel corpus and the train/test data in the target domain.", 
        "187": "We should also point out that in Table 2, the four baseline methods (PL-LSI, PL-KCCA, PL-OPCA and PL-MC) were evaluated under the condition of using additional 100 labeled target documents for training, according to the author\u2019s report (Xiao and Guo, 2013).", 
        "188": "On the other hand, our methods (CLD-KCNN and CLDFA-KCNN) were evaluated under a tougher condition, i.e., not using any labeled data in the target domains.", 
        "189": "We also test our framework when a few training documents in the target language are available.", 
        "190": "A simple way to utilize the target-language supervision is to fit the target-language model with labeled target data after optimizing with our crosslingual distillation framework.", 
        "191": "The performance of CLD-KCNN and CLDFA-KCNN trained with different sizes of labeled target-language data is shown in figure 3.", 
        "192": "We also compare the performance of training the same classifier using only\nthe target-language labels(Target Only in figure 3).", 
        "193": "As we can see, our framework can efficiently utilize the extra supervision and improve the performance over the training using only the targetlanguage labels.", 
        "194": "The margin is most significant when the size of the target-language label is relatively small.", 
        "195": "6 Conclusion  This work introduces a novel framework for distillation of discriminative knowledge across languages, providing effective and efficient algorithmic solutions for addressing domain/distribution mismatch issues in CLTC.", 
        "196": "The excellent performance of our approach is evident in our evaluation on two CLTC benchmark datasets, compared to that of other state-of-the-art methods.",

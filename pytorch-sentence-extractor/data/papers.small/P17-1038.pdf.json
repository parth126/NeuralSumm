        "109": "And the objective of multi-instance learning is to discriminate bags rather than instances.",

        "155": "Then we choose the same number of key arguments in all methods and use these key arguments to label data.", 
        "156": "After that we evaluate these methods by using above automatic evaluations based on ACE data.", 
        "157": "Results are shown in Table 5.", 
        "158": "ACE+KR achieve the best performance in both stages.", 
        "159": "This demonstrates the effectiveness of our KR methods.", 
        "160": "To explore the impact of different numbers of key arguments, we sort all arguments of each type of events according to KR value and select top k arguments as the key arguments.", 
        "161": "Examples are shown in Table 2.", 
        "162": "Then we automatically evaluate the performance by using automatic evaluations proposed above.", 
        "163": "Figure 6 shows the results, when we set k = 2, the method achieves a best\nperformance in both stages.", 
        "164": "Then, the F1 value reduces as k grows.", 
        "165": "The reason is that the heuristics for data labeling are stricter as k grows.", 
        "166": "As a result, less training data is generated.", 
        "167": "For example, if k = 2, we will get 25, 797 sentences labeled as people.marriage events and we will get 534 labeled sentences, if k = 3.", 
        "168": "However, when we set k = 1, although more labeled data are generated, the precision could not be guaranteed.", 
        "169": "Impact of Trigger Rate and FrameNet\nIn this section, we prove the effectiveness of TR and FrameNet to find triggers.", 
        "170": "We specifically select two methods as baselines: TCF and TETF.", 
        "171": "TCF, TETF and TR respectively use the trigger candidate frequency, trigger event type frequency and trigger rate to sort trigger candidates of each type of events.", 
        "172": "Then we generate initial trigger lexicon by using all trigger candidates with high TCF value, TETF value or TR value.", 
        "173": "We set these hyper parameters as 0.8, 0.9 and 0.8, respectively, which are determined by grid search from (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0).", 
        "174": "FrameNet was used to filter noisy verbal triggers and expand nominal triggers.", 
        "175": "Trigger examples generated by TR+Framenet are shown in Table 2.", 
        "176": "Then we evaluate the performance of these methods by using above automatic evaluations.", 
        "177": "Results are shown in Table 6, Compared with ACE+TCF and ACE+TETF, ACE+TR gains a higher performance in both stages.", 
        "178": "It demonstrates the effectiveness of our TR methods.", 
        "179": "When we use FrameNet to generate triggers, compared with ACE+TR, we get a 1.0 improvement on trigger classification and a 1.7 improvement on argument classification.", 
        "180": "Such improvements are higher than improvements gained by other methods (TCF, IEF, TR), which demonstrates the effectiveness of the usage of FrameNet.", 
        "181": "5.5 Performance of DMCNN-MIL  Following previous work (Mintz et al., 2009) in distant supervised RE, we evaluate our method in two ways: held-out and manual evaluation.", 
        "182": "Held-out Evaluation In the held-out evaluation, we hold out part of the Freebase event data during training, and compare newly discovered event instances against this heldout data.", 
        "183": "We use the following criteria to judge the correctness of each predicted event automatically: (1) An event is correct if its key arguments and event type match those of an event instance in Freebase; (2) An argument is correctly classified if its event type and argument role match those of any of the argument instance in the corresponding Freebase event.", 
        "184": "Figure 7 and Figure 8 show the precision-recall (P-R) curves for each method in the two stages of event extraction respectively.", 
        "185": "We can see that multi-instance learning is effective to alleviate the noise problem in our distant supervised event extraction.", 
        "186": "Human Evaluation Because the incomplete nature of Freebase, heldout evaluation suffers from false negatives problem.", 
        "187": "We also perform a manual evaluation to eliminate these problems.", 
        "188": "In the manual evaluation, we manually check the newly discovered event instances that are not in Freebase.", 
        "189": "Because the number of these event instances in the test data is unknown, we cannot calculate the recall in this case.", 
        "190": "Instead, we calculate the precision of the top n extracted event instances.", 
        "191": "The human evaluation results are presented in Table 7.", 
        "192": "We can see that DMCNNs-MIL achieves the best performance.", 
        "193": "6 Related Work  Most of previous event extraction work focused on supervised learning paradigm and trained event extractors on human-annotated data which yield relatively high performance.", 
        "194": "(Ahn, 2006; Ji and Grishman, 2008; Hong et al., 2011; McClosky et al., 2011; Li et al., 2013, 2014; Chen et al., 2015; Nguyen and Grishman, 2015; Nguyen et al., 2016).", 
        "195": "However, these supervised methods depend on the quality of the training data and labeled training data is expensive to produce.", 
        "196": "Unsupervised methods can extract large numbers of events without using labeled data (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2011; Cheung et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2016).", 
        "197": "But extracted events may not be easy to be mapped to events for a particular knowledge base.", 
        "198": "Distant supervision have been used in relation extraction for automatically labeling training data (Mintz et al., 2009; Hinton et al., 2012; Krause et al., 2012; Krishnamurthy and Mitchell, 2012; Berant et al., 2013; Surdeanu et al., 2012; Zeng et al., 2015).", 
        "199": "But DS for RE cannot directly use for EE.", 
        "200": "For the reasons that an event is more complicated than a relation and the task of EE is more difficult than RE.", 
        "201": "The best reported supervised RE and EE system got a F1-score of 88.0% (Wang et al., 2016) and 55.4% (Nguyen et al., 2016) respectively.", 
        "202": "Reschke et al.", 
        "203": "(2014) extended the distant supervision approach to fill slots in plane crash.", 
        "204": "However, the method can only extract arguments of one plane crash type and need flight number strings as input.", 
        "205": "In other words, the approach cannot extract whole event with different types automatically.", 
        "206": "7 Conclusion and Future Work  In this paper, we present an approach to automatically label training data for EE.", 
        "207": "The experimental\nresults show the quality of our large scale automatically labeled data is competitive with elaborately human-annotated data.", 
        "208": "Also, we provide a DMCNN-MIL model for this data as a baseline for further research.", 
        "209": "In the future, we will use the proposed automatically data labeling method to more event types and explore more models to extract events by using automatically labeled data.",

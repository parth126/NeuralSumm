        "6": "Although general relation detection1 methods are well studied in the NLP community, such studies usually do not take the end task of KBQA into consideration.", 
        "7": "As a result, there is a significant gap between general relation detection studies and KB-specific relation detection.", 
        "8": "First, in most general relation detection tasks, the number of target relations is limited, normally smaller than 100.",

        "48": "from TransE (Bordes et al., 2013)), like (Dai et al., 2016); (2) factorize the relation names to sequences and formulate relation detection as a sequence matching and ranking task.",

        "62": "However, while the questions are natural word sequences, how to represent relations as sequences remains a challenging problem.",

        "65": "In this case, each relation name is treated as a unique token.", 
        "66": "The problem with this approach is that it suffers from the low relation coverage due to limited amount of training data, thus cannot generalize well to large number of opendomain relations.", 
        "67": "For example, in Figure 1, when treating relation names as single tokens, it will be difficult to match the questions to relation names \u201cepisodes written\u201d and \u201cstarring roles\u201d if these names do not appear in training data \u2013 their relation embeddings hrs will be random vectors thus are not comparable to question embeddings hqs.", 
        "68": "(2) Relation as Word Sequence (word-level).", 
        "69": "In this case, the relation is treated as a sequence of words from the tokenized relation name.", 
        "70": "It has better generalization, but suffers from the lack of global information from the original relation names.", 
        "71": "For example in Figure 1(b), when doing only word-level matching, it is difficult to rank the target relation \u201cstarring roles\u201d higher compared to the incorrect relation \u201cplays produced\u201d.", 
        "72": "This is because the incorrect relation contains word \u201cplays\u201d, which is more similar to the question\n3Such entity information has been used in KBQA systems as features for the final answer re-rankers.", 
        "73": "(containing word \u201cplay\u201d) in the embedding space.", 
        "74": "On the other hand, if the target relation co-occurs with questions related to \u201ctv appearance\u201d in training, by treating the whole relation as a token (i.e.", 
        "75": "relation id), we could better learn the correspondence between this token and phrases like \u201ctv show\u201d and \u201cplay on\u201d.", 
        "76": "The two types of relation representation contain different levels of abstraction.", 
        "77": "As shown in Table 1, the word-level focuses more on local information (words and short phrases), and the relation-level focus more on global information (long phrases and skip-grams) but suffer from data sparsity.", 
        "78": "Since both these levels of granularity have their own pros and cons, we propose a hierarchical matching approach for KB relation detection: for a candidate relation, our approach matches the input question to both word-level and relation-level representations to get the final ranking score.",

        "83": "Therefore, the input relation becomes r = {rword1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , rwordM1 } [ {rrel1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , rrelM2}, where the first M1 tokens are words (e.g.", 
        "84": "{episode, written}), and the last M2 tokens are relation names, e.g., {episode written} or {starring roles, series} (when the target is a chain like in Figure 1(b)).", 
        "85": "We transform each token above to its word embed-\nding then use two BiLSTMs (with shared parameters) to get their hidden representations [Bword1:M1 : Brel1:M2 ] (each row vector i is the concatenation between forward/backward representations at i).", 
        "86": "We initialize the relation sequence LSTMs with the final state representations of the word sequence, as a back-off for unseen relations.", 
        "87": "We apply one max-pooling on these two sets of vectors and get the final relation representation hr.", 
        "88": "4.2 Different Abstractions of Questions Representations  From Table 1, we can see that different parts of a relation could match different contexts of question texts.", 
        "89": "Usually relation names could match longer phrases in the question and relation words could match short phrases.", 
        "90": "Yet different words might match phrases of different lengths.", 
        "91": "As a result, we hope the question representations could also comprise vectors that summarize various lengths of phrase information (different levels of abstraction), in order to match relation representations of different granularity.", 
        "92": "We deal with this problem by applying deep BiLSTMs on questions.", 
        "93": "The first-layer of BiLSTM works on the word embeddings of question words q = {q1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , qN} and gets hidden representations\n(1) 1:N = [ (1) 1 ; \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ; (1) N ].", 
        "94": "The second-layer BiLSTM works on (1)1:N to get the second set of hidden representations (2)1:N .", 
        "95": "Since the second BiLSTM starts with the hidden vectors from the first layer, intuitively it could learn more general and abstract information compared to the first layer.", 
        "96": "Note that the first(second)-layer of question representations does not necessarily correspond to the word(relation)-level relation representations, instead either layer of question representations could potentially match to either level of relation representations.", 
        "97": "This raises the difficulty of matching between different levels of relation/question representations; the following section gives our proposal to deal with such problem.", 
        "98": "4.3 Hierarchical Matching between Relation and Question  Now we have question contexts of different lengths encoded in (1)1:N and (2) 1:N .", 
        "99": "Unlike the standard usage of deep BiLSTMs that employs the representations in the final layer for prediction, here we expect that two layers of question representations can be complementary to each other and both should be compared to the relation representation space (Hierarchical Matching).", 
        "100": "This is important for our task since each relation token can correspond to phrases of different lengths, mainly because of syntactic variations.", 
        "101": "For example in Table 1, the relation word written could be matched to either the same single word in the question or a much longer phrase be the writer of.", 
        "102": "We could perform the above hierarchical matching by computing the similarity between each layer of and hr separately and doing the (weighted) sum between the two scores.", 
        "103": "However this does not give significant improvement (see Table 2).", 
        "104": "Our analysis in Section 6.2 shows that this naive method suffers from the training difficulty, evidenced by that the converged training loss of this model is much higher than that of a single-layer baseline model.", 
        "105": "This is mainly because (1) Deep BiLSTMs do not guarantee that the two-levels of question hidden representations are comparable, the training usually falls to local optima where one layer has good matching scores and the other always has weight close to 0.", 
        "106": "(2)\nThe training of deeper architectures itself is more difficult.", 
        "107": "To overcome the above difficulties, we adopt the idea from Residual Networks (He et al., 2016) for hierarchical matching by adding shortcut connections between two BiLSTM layers.", 
        "108": "We proposed two ways of such Hierarchical Residual Matching: (1) Connecting each (1)i and (2) i , resulting in a 0 i = (1) i + (2) i for each position i.",

        "111": "Finally we compute the matching score of r given q as srel(r;q) = cos(hr,hq).", 
        "112": "Intuitively, the proposed method should benefit from hierarchical training since the second layer is fitting the residues from the first layer of matching, so the two layers of representations are more likely to be complementary to each other.", 
        "113": "This also ensures the vector spaces of two layers are comparable and makes the second-layer training easier.", 
        "114": "During training we adopt a ranking loss to maximizing the margin between the gold relation r+ and other relations r in the candidate pool R.\nlrel = max{0, srel(r+;q) + srel(r ;q)} where is a constant parameter.",

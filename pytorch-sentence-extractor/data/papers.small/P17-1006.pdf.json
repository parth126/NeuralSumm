        "196": "The morph-fixed vectors do not enhance DST performance, probably because fixing word vectors to their highest frequency inflectional form eliminates useful semantic content encoded in the original vectors.",

        "198": "These conclusions are in line with the SimLex gains, where morph-fitting outperforms both distributional and morph-fixed vectors.", 
        "199": "English performance shows little variation across the four word vector collections investigated here.", 
        "200": "This corroborates our intuition that, as a morphologically simpler language, English stands to gain less from fine-tuning the morphological variation for downstream applications.", 
        "201": "This result again points at the discrepancy between intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation: the considerable gains in SimLex performance do not necessarily induce similar gains in downstream performance.",

        "203": "While we observe a slight drop in SimLex performance with the DE MFIT-AR vectors compared to the MFIT-A ones, their relative performance is reversed in the DST task.",

        "207": "6 Related Work  Semantic Specialisation A standard approach to incorporating external information into vector spaces is to pull the representations of similar words closer together.",

        "211": "However, instead of resorting to curated knowledge bases, and experimenting solely with English, we show that the morphological richness of any language can be exploited as a source of inexpensive supervision for fine-tuning vector spaces, at the same time specialising them to better reflect true semantic similarity, and learning more accurate representations for low-frequency words.",

        "223": "Another practical difference is that we focus on similarity and evaluate morph-fitting in a well-defined downstream task where the artefacts of the distributional hypothesis are known to prompt statistical system failures.",

        "227": "Finally, we have shown that the use of morph-fitted vectors boosts the performance of downstream language understanding models which rely on word representations as features, especially for morphologically rich languages such as German.",

        "2": "While achieving stateof-the-art performance, these models rely on a large amount of labeled data.", 
        "3": "However, it is extremely difficult to collect large-scale question answering datasets.", 
        "4": "Historically, many of the question answering datasets have only thousands of question answering pairs, such as WebQuestions (Berant et al., 2013), MCTest (Richardson et al., 2013), WikiQA (Yang et al., 2015), and TREC-QA (Voorhees and Tice, 2000).",

        "7": "Compared to obtaining labeled question answer pairs, it is trivial to obtain unlabeled text data.", 
        "8": "In this work, we study the following problem of semi-supervised question answering: is it possible to leverage unlabeled text to boost the performance of question answering models, especially when only a small amount of labeled data is available?", 
        "9": "The problem is challenging because conventional manifold-based semi-supervised learning algorithms (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002; Yang et al., 2016a) cannot be straightforwardly applied.", 
        "10": "Moreover, since the main foci of most question answering tasks are extraction rather than generation, it is also not sensible to use unlabeled text to improve language modeling as in machine translation (Gulcehre et al., 2015).", 
        "11": "To better leverage the unlabeled text, we propose a novel neural framework called Generative Domain-Adaptive Nets (GDANs).",

        "35": "In addition to the labeled dataset L, in the semisupervised setting, we are also given a set of unlabeled data, denoted as U = {a(i), p(i)}Mi=1, where M is the number of unlabeled instances.", 
        "36": "Note that it is usually trivial to have access to an almost infinite number of paragraphs p from sources such as Wikipedia articles and other web pages.",

        "38": "We will discuss the technical details of answer chunk extraction in Section 4.1, and in the formulation of our framework, we assume that the answer chunks a are available.", 
        "39": "Given both the labeled data L and the unlabeled data U , the goal of semi-supervised question answering is to learn a question answering model D that captures the probability distribution P(a|p, q).",

        "65": "Learning from both human-generated data and model-generated data can thus lead to a biased model.", 
        "66": "To alleviate this issue, we propose to view the model-generated data distribution and the human-generated data distribution as two different data domains and explicitly incorporate domain adaptation into the discriminative model.", 
        "67": "More specifically, we use a domain tag as an additional input to the discriminative model.",

        "81": "Similar to the Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and adversarial domain adaptation (Ganin and Lempitsky, 2014), the discriminative model and the generative model have different objectives in our framework.", 
        "82": "However, rather than formulating the objective as an adversarial game between the two models (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Ganin and Lempitsky, 2014), in our framework, the discriminative model relies on the data generated by\nthe generative model, while the generative model aims to match the model-generated data distribution with the human-generated data distribution using the signals from the discriminative model.", 
        "83": "Given a labeled datasetL = {p(i), q(i), a(i)}Ni=1, the objective function of a discriminative modelD for a supervised learning setting can be written as\u2211\np(i),q(i),a(i)\u2208L logPD(a(i)|p(i), q(i)), where PD is a probability distribution defined by the model D. Since we also incorporate domain tags into the model D, we denote the objective function as\nJ(L, tag, D) = 1 |L| \u2211\np(i),q(i),a(i)\u2208L\nlog PD,tag(a (i)|p(i), q(i))\nmeaning that the domain tag, \u201ctag\u201d, is appended to the dataset L. We use |L| = N to denote the number of the instances in the dataset L. The objective function is averaged over all instances such that we can balance labeled and unlabeled data.", 
        "84": "Let UG denote the dataset obtained by generating questions on the unlabeled dataset U with the generative model G. The objective of the discriminative model is then to maximize J for both labeled and unlabeled data under the domain adaptation notions, i.e., J(L, d true, D) + J(UG, d gen, D).", 
        "85": "Now we discuss the objective of the generative model.", 
        "86": "Similar to the dual learning (Xia et al., 2016) framework, one can define an autoencoder objective.", 
        "87": "In this case, the generative model aims to generate questions that can be reconstructed by the discriminative model, i.e., maximizing J(UG, d gen, D).", 
        "88": "However, this objective function can lead to degenerate solutions because the questions can be thought of as an overcomplete representation of the answers (Vincent et al., 2010).", 
        "89": "For example, given p and a, the generative model might learn to generate trivial questions such as copying the answers, which does not contributed to learning a better D.\nInstead, we leverage the discriminative model to better match the model-generated data distribution with the human-generated data distribution.",

        "103": "The generator G has two training phases\u2013MLE training and RL training, which are different in that: 1) RL training does not require labels, so G can explore a broader data domain of p using unlabeled data, while MLE training requires labels; 2) MLE maximizes logP (q|p, a), while RL maximizes logPD(a|q, p).", 
        "104": "Since logP (q|a, p) is the sum of logP (q|p) and logP (a|q, p) (plus a constant), maximizing logP (a|q, p) does not require modeling logP (q|p) that is irrelevant to QA, which makes optimization easier.",

        "132": "When implementing these two baselines, we adopt the learning schedule introduced by Ganin and Lempitsky (2014), i.e., gradually increasing the weights of the gradients for the generative model G.  4.3 Results and Analysis  We study the performance of different models with varying labeling rates and unlabeled dataset sizes.", 
        "133": "Labeling rates are the percentage of training instances that are used to train D. The results are reported in Table 2.", 
        "134": "Though the unlabeled dataset we collect consists of around 5 million instances, we also sample a subset of around 50,000 instances to evaluate the effects of the size of unlabeled data.", 
        "135": "The highest labeling rate in Table 2 is 0.9 because 10% of the training instances are used for testing.", 
        "136": "Since we do early stopping on the development set using the F1 scores, we also report the development F1.", 
        "137": "We report two metrics, the F1 scores and the exact matching (EM) scores (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), on the test set.", 
        "138": "All metrics are computed using the official evaluation scripts.", 
        "139": "SL v.s.", 
        "140": "SSL.", 
        "141": "We observe that semi-supervised learning leads to consistent improvements over supervised learning in all cases.", 
        "142": "Such improvements are substantial when labeled data is limited.", 
        "143": "For example, the GDANs improve over supervised learning by 9.87 points in F1 and 7.26 points in\nEM when the labeling rate is 0.1.", 
        "144": "With our semisupervised learning approach, we can use only 0.1 training instances to obtain even better performance than a supervised learning approach with 0.2 training instances, saving more than half of the labeling costs.", 
        "145": "Comparison with Baselines.", 
        "146": "By comparing \u201cGen + domain + adv\u201d with \u201cGen + GAN\u201d and \u201cGen + Dual\u201d, it is clear that the GDANs perform substantially better than GANs and dual learning.", 
        "147": "With labeling rate 0.1, GDANs outperform dual learning and GANs by 2.47 and 4.29 points respectively in terms of F1.", 
        "148": "Ablation Study.", 
        "149": "We also perform an ablation study by examining the effects of \u201cdomain\u201d and \u201cadv\u201d when added to \u201cgen\u201d.", 
        "150": "It can be seen that both the domain tags and the adversarial training contribute to the performance of the GDANs when the labeling rate is equal to or less than 0.5.", 
        "151": "With labeling rate 0.9, adding domain tags still leads to better performance but adversarial training does not seem to improve the performance by much.", 
        "152": "Unlabeled Data Size.", 
        "153": "Moreover, we observe that the performance can be further improved when a larger unlabeled dataset is used, though the gain is relatively less significant compared to changing the model architectures.", 
        "154": "For example, increasing the unlabeled dataset size from 50K to 5M, the performance of GDANs increases by 0.38 points in F1 and 0.52 points in EM.", 
        "155": "Context-Based Method.", 
        "156": "Surprisingly, the simple context-based method, though performing worse than GDANs, still leads to substantial gains; e.g., 7.00 points in F1 with labeling rate 0.1.", 
        "157": "Adding domain tags can improve the performance of the context-based method as well.", 
        "158": "MLE vs RL.", 
        "159": "We plot the loss curve of \u2212J(UG, d gen, D) for both the MLE-trained generator (\u201cGen + domain\u201d) and the RL-trained generator (\u201cGen + domain + adv\u201d) in Figure 2.", 
        "160": "We observe that the training loss for D on RLgenerated questions is lower than MLE-generated questions, which confirms that RL training maximizes logP (a|p, q).", 
        "161": "Samples of Generated Questions.", 
        "162": "We present some questions generated by our model in Table 1.", 
        "163": "The generated questions are post-processed by removing repeated subs-sequences.", 
        "164": "Compared to MLE-generated questions, RL-generated questions are more informative (Cf., P1, P2, and P4), and contain less \u201cUNK\u201d (unknown) tokens (Cf.,\nP1).", 
        "165": "Moreover, both semantically and syntactically, RL-generated questions are more accurate (Cf., P3 and P5).", 
        "166": "5 Related Work  Semi-Supervised Learning.", 
        "167": "Semi-supervised learning has been extensively studied in literature (Zhu, 2005).", 
        "168": "A batch of novel models have been recently proposed for semi-supervised learning based on representation learning techniques, such as generative models (Kingma et al., 2014), ladder networks (Rasmus et al., 2015) and graph embeddings (Yang et al., 2016a).", 
        "169": "However, most of the semi-supervised learning methods are based on combinations of the supervised loss p(y|x) and an unsupervised loss p(x).", 
        "170": "In the context of reading comprehension, directly modeling the likelihood of a paragraph would not possibly improve the supervised task of question answering.", 
        "171": "Moreover, traditional graph-based semisupervised learning (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002) cannot be easily extended to modeling the unlabeled answer chunks.", 
        "172": "Domain Adaptation.", 
        "173": "Domain adaptation has been successfully applied to various tasks, such as classification (Ganin and Lempitsky, 2014) and machine translation (Johnson et al., 2016; Chu et al., 2017).", 
        "174": "Several techniques on domain adaptation (Glorot et al., 2011) focus on learning distribution invariant features by sharing the intermediate representations for downstream tasks.", 
        "175": "Another line of research on domain adaptation attempt to match the distance between different domain distributions in a low dimensional space (Long et al., 2015; Baktashmotlagh et al., 2013).", 
        "176": "There are\nalso methods seeking a domain transition from the source domain to the target domain (Gong et al., 2012; Gopalan et al., 2011; Pan et al., 2011).", 
        "177": "Our work gets inspiration from a practice in Johnson et al.", 
        "178": "(2016) and Chu et al.", 
        "179": "(2017) based on appending domain tags.", 
        "180": "However, our method is different from the above methods in that we apply domain adaptation techniques to the outputs of a generative model rather than a natural data domain.", 
        "181": "Question Answering.", 
        "182": "Various neural models based on attention mechanisms (Wang and Jiang, 2016; Seo et al., 2016; Xiong et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Dhingra et al., 2016; Kadlec et al., 2016; Trischler et al., 2016b; Sordoni et al., 2016; Cui et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016) have been proposed to tackle the tasks of question answering and reading comprehension.", 
        "183": "However, the performance of these neural models largely relies on a large amount of labeled data available for training.", 
        "184": "Learning with Multiple Models.", 
        "185": "GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) formulated a adversarial game between a discriminative model and a generative model for generating realistic images.",

        "187": "Review networks (Yang et al., 2016b) employ a discriminative model as a regularizer for training a generative model.", 
        "188": "In the context of machine translation, given a language pair, various recent work studied jointly training models to learn the mappings in both directions (Tu et al., 2016; Xia et al., 2016).",

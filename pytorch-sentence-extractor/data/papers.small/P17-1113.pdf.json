        "138": "The jointly extracting methods used in this paper are listed as follows: (4) DS-Joint (Li and Ji, 2014) is a supervised method, which jointly extracts entities and relations using structured perceptron on human-annotated dataset; (5) MultiR (Hoffmann et al., 2011) is a typical distant supervised method based on multi-instance learning algorithms to combat the noisy training data; (6) CoType (Ren et al., 2017) is a domain independent framework by jointly embedding entity mentions, relation mentions, text features and type labels into meaningful representations.", 
        "139": "In addition, we also compare our method with two classical end-to-end tagging models: LSTMCRF (Lample et al., 2016) and LSTM-LSTM\n(Vaswani et al., 2016).", 
        "140": "LSTM-CRF is proposed for entity recognition by using a bidirectional LSTM to encode input sentence and a conditional random fields to predict the entity tag sequence.", 
        "141": "Different from LSTM-CRF, LSTM-LSTM uses a LSTM layer to decode the tag sequence instead of CRF.", 
        "142": "They are used for the first time to jointly extract entities and relations based on our tagging scheme.", 
        "143": "4.2 Experimental Results  We report the results of different methods as shown in Table 1.", 
        "144": "It can be seen that our method, LSTM-LSTM-Bias, outperforms all other methods in F1 score and achieves a 3% improvement in F1 over the best method CoType (Ren et al., 2017).", 
        "145": "It shows the effectiveness of our proposed method.", 
        "146": "Furthermore, from Table 1, we also can see that the jointly extracting methods are better than pipelined methods, and the tagging methods are better than most of the jointly extracting methods.", 
        "147": "It also validates the validity of our tagging scheme for the task of jointly extracting entities and relations.", 
        "148": "When compared with the traditional methods, the precisions of the end-to-end models are significantly improved.", 
        "149": "But only LSTM-LSTM-Bias can be better to balance the precision and recall.", 
        "150": "The reason may be that these end-to-end models all use a Bi-LSTM encoding input sentence and different neural networks to decode the results.", 
        "151": "The methods based on neural networks can well fit the data.", 
        "152": "Therefore, they can learn the common features of the training set well and may lead to the lower expansibility.", 
        "153": "We also find that the LSTM-LSTM\nmodel is better than LSTM-CRF model based on our tagging scheme.", 
        "154": "Because, LSTM is capable of learning long-term dependencies and CRF (Lafferty et al., 2001) is good at capturing the joint probability of the entire sequence of labels.", 
        "155": "The related tags may have a long distance from each other.", 
        "156": "Hence, LSTM decoding manner is a little better than CRF.", 
        "157": "LSTM-LSTM-Bias adds a bias weight to enhance the effect of entity tags and weaken the effect of invalid tag.", 
        "158": "Therefore, in this tagging scheme, our method can be better than the common LSTM-decoding methods.", 
        "159": "5 Analysis and Discussion    5.1 Error Analysis  In this paper, we focus on extracting triplets composed of two entities and a relation.", 
        "160": "Table 1 has shown the predict results of the task.", 
        "161": "It treats an triplet is correct only when the relation type and the head offsets of two corresponding entities are both correct.", 
        "162": "In order to find out the factors that affect the results of end-to-end models, we analyze the performance on predicting each element in the triplet as Table 2 shows.", 
        "163": "E1 and E2 represent the performance on predicting each entity, respectively.", 
        "164": "If the head offset of the first entity is correct, then the instance of E1 is correct, the same to E2.", 
        "165": "Regardless of relation type, if the head offsets of two corresponding entities are both correct, the instance of (E1, E2) is correct.", 
        "166": "As shown in Table 2, (E1, E2) has higher precision when compared with E1 and E2.", 
        "167": "But its recall result is lower than E1 and E2.", 
        "168": "It means that some of the predicted entities do not form a pair.", 
        "169": "They only obtain E1 and do not find its corresponding E2, or obtain E2 and do not find its corresponding E1.", 
        "170": "Thus it leads to the prediction of more single E and less (E1, E2) pairs.", 
        "171": "Therefore, entity pair (E1, E2) has higher precision and lower recall than single E. Besides, the predicted results of (E1, E2) in Table 2 have about 3% improvement when compared predicted results in Table 1, which means that 3% of the test data is\npredicted to be wrong because the relation type is predicted to be wrong.", 
        "172": "5.2 Analysis of Biased Loss  Different from LSTM-CRF and LSTM-LSTM, our approach is biased towards relational labels to enhance links between entities.", 
        "173": "In order to further analyze the effect of the bias objective function, we visualize the ratio of predicted single entities for each end-to-end method as Figure 4.", 
        "174": "The single entities refer to those who cannot find their corresponding entities.", 
        "175": "Figure 4 shows whether it is E1 or E2, our method can get a relatively low ratio on the single entities.", 
        "176": "It means that our method can effectively associate two entities when compared LSTM-CRF and LSTM-LSTM which pay little attention to the relational tags.", 
        "177": "Besides, we also change the Bias Parameter \u03b1 from 1 to 20, and the predicted results are shown in Figure 5.", 
        "178": "If \u03b1 is too large, it will affect the accuracy of prediction and if \u03b1 is too small, the recall will decline.", 
        "179": "When \u03b1 = 10, LSTM-LSTMBias can balance the precision and recall, and can achieve the best F1 scores.", 
        "180": "5.3 Case Study  In this section, we observe the prediction results of end-to-end methods, and then select several representative examples to illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of the methods as Table 3 shows.", 
        "181": "Each example contains three row, the first row is the gold standard, the second and the third rows are the extracted results of model LSTM-LSTM and LSTM-LSTM-Bias respectively.", 
        "182": "S1 represents the situation that the distance between the two interrelated entities is far away\nfrom each other, which is more difficult to detect their relationships.", 
        "183": "When compared with LSTMLSTM, LSTM-LSTM-Bias uses a bias objective function which enhance the relevance between entities.", 
        "184": "Therefore, in this example, LSTM-LSTMBias can extract two related entities, while LSTMLSTM can only extract one entity of \u201cFlorida\u201d and can not detect entity \u201cPanama City Beach\u201d.", 
        "185": "S2 is a negative example that shows these methods may mistakenly predict one of the entity.", 
        "186": "There are no indicative words between entities Nuremberg and Germany.", 
        "187": "Besides, the patten \u201ca * of *\u201d between Germany and MiddleAges may be easy to mislead the models that there exists a relation of \u201cContains\u201d between them.", 
        "188": "The problem can be solved by adding some samples of this kind of expression patterns to the training data.", 
        "189": "S3 is a case that models can predict the entities\u2019 head offset right, but the relational role is wrong.", 
        "190": "LSTM-LSTM treats both \u201cStephen A. Schwarzman\u201d and \u201cBlackstone Group\u201d as entity E1, and can not find its corresponding E2.", 
        "191": "Although, LSTM-LSMT\u2013Bias can find the entities pair (E1, E2), it reverses the roles of \u201cStephen A. Schwarzman\u201d and \u201cBlackstone Group\u201d.", 
        "192": "It shows that LSTM-LSTM-Bias is able to better on pre-\ndicting entities pair, but it remains to be improved in distinguishing the relationship between the two entities.", 
        "193": "6 Conclusion  In this paper, we propose a novel tagging scheme and investigate the end-to-end models to jointly extract entities and relations.", 
        "194": "The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed method.", 
        "195": "But it still has shortcoming on the identification of the overlapping relations.", 
        "196": "In the future work, we will replace the softmax function in the output layer with multiple classifier, so that a word can has multiple tags.", 
        "197": "In this way, a word can appear in multiple triplet results, which can solve the problem of overlapping relations.", 
        "198": "Although, our model can enhance the effect of entity tags, the association between two corresponding entities still requires refinement in next works.",

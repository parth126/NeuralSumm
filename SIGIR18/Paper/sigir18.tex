\begin{abstract}
In this work, we present a weakly supervised sentence extraction technique for identifying important sentences in scientific papers that are worthy of inclusion in the abstract. We propose a method for determining the focus of a given paper using topic models and use it to create document-level context. We also propose an attention based sentence encoding model that jointly learns to identify important content as well as the cue phrases that are indicative of summary worthy sentences. We use a collection of articles publicly available through ACL anthology for our experiments. Our system achieves a performance that is generally better, in terms of ROUGE scores, as compared to several state of art extractive techniques.
